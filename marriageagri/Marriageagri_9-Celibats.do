TITLE:
The political and sexual economies of marriages. Two decades of change in South-Arcot, South India

AUTHORS:
I. GuÃ©rin, A. Natal, C. J. Nordman, and G. Venkatasubramanian

JOURNAL:
Contemporary South Asia

ABSTRACT:
This chapter explores the multifaceted role of marriages in the south-Arcot region of central Tamil Nadu.
There are cases of forced celibacy, but they remain isolated.
By mobilising twenty years of ethnographic survey, and three household surveys conducted in 2010, 2016-17 and 2020-21, including questions on marriages (who marries whom? at what cost? with a dowry and if so how much?), this paper will examine how marriages are both shaped by and constitutive of local political and sexual economies. 
By local political and sexual economies, we mean the intertwining of access to material resources, norms of kinship and deviant sexuality.
As feminist anthropology has long shown, modes of accumulation, kinship and sexuality are inseparable and mutually constructed.
The drastic and interconnected changes observed over the last two decades in modes of production, marital alliances and the control of female sexuality are a clear illustration of this.
Our data suggest two main findings, which explains the reasons behind low prevalence of forced celibacy, while highlighting the intensification of patriarchal norms: First, marriages and marital transfers (primarily dowry) play a crucial role in compensating for a volatile economy, whether it is agricultural decline (with the exception of the pandemic period, agricultural incomes are declining, both in absolute and relative terms), a precarious and uncertain non-farm labour market, and costly and risky investments in education (of boys in particular) and expensive housing expenditures.
In turn, and this is our second argument, the dowry, which is a recent practice among the lower castes and classes, strongly devalues the economic value of young girls and is accompanied by increasing control over women's bodies and sexuality as a symbol of upward mobility.
The paper will also examine the differences between families that remained solely peasant and those that diversified, exploring the role of marriages and marriage payments in these differentiated strategies.
