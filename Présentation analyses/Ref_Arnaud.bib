  abstract = {Le processus de libéralisation initié en Inde à partir des années 1980 s’est accompagné d’une multitude de changements économiques, politiques et sociaux qui ont participé à modifier l’organisation et la
structure de l’emploi. Ces changements structurels ont par ailleurs redessiné les pratiques migratoires au gré des besoins de main-d’oeuvre. L’objet de ces travaux de recherche est d’étudier comment la
structuration des marchés du travail en Inde a participé à modifier les flux de migrations internes, mais également de s’intéresser à l’évolution de ces pratiques migratoires. Pour cela, nous proposons une
approche multi-scalaire des liens entre marchés de l’emploi et mouvements migratoires, menée conjointement à des niveaux micro et macro. Ainsi, après avoir effectué une revue de littérature des
théories migratoires, nous traitons dans une première partie les liens entre marché du travail et migration de travail au niveau macro-économique. Pour cela, nous avons identifié pour les différentes
régions de l’Inde une typologie des marchés du travail à partir de laquelle les flux de migrations ont été spatialisés. Dans une seconde partie, le niveau micro a été privilégié et les résultats présentés
s’appuient sur un travail de terrain mené entre 2010 et 2014 dans le Sud de l’Inde (Tamil Nadu). Il s’agit, à partir d’une approche mixte combinant des méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives, d’étudier la
circulation du travail en milieu rural tamoul. Cette démarche nous a permis d’identifier une variété de formes de migrations de travail aux logiques singulières ; nous parlons alors de diversification de
pratiques migratoires.},

  abstract  = {Le mariage a une histoire, que raconte ce livre : simple contrat privé entre deux familles dans le monde antique, il devient au Moyen Âge un mariage-sacrement, monogamique et indissoluble, que régit l'Église. La Réforme protestante porte une première atteinte à l'institution en lui déniant son caractère sacramentel. Nouvelle secousse : la Révolution française retire à l'Église son pouvoir de marier pour le confier à l'autorité civile. Le code civil, enfin, se met en place, plusieurs fois remanié au gré de l'évolution des moeurs : c'est en 1884 que la loi Naquet autorise le divorce.
Cette histoire vivante, centrée sur la France et l'Europe, croise les approches historique, juridique, sociologique, littéraire et artistique et balaye beaucoup d'idées reçues. Non, la crise du mariage ne date pas d'aujourd'hui : la Grèce et la Rome antiques pénalisaient les célibataires pour les inciter à convoler. Non, les familles recomposées ne sont pas une invention moderne : les couples de l'Ancien Régime duraient en moyenne une douzaine d'années, brisés par une mort précoce, et le veuf, ou la veuve, refondait une famille. Oui, en 1904, fêtant l'anniversaire du code civil, un député a proposé d'ajouter le mot " amour " aux devoirs mutuels des époux – fidélité, secours, assistance !
Aujourd'hui, l'émancipation des femmes, la libération sexuelle et les avancées scientifiques en matière de procréation ont largement bouleversé les données de cette " civilisation conjugale " mais l'institution a encore de beaux jours devant elle.},

"D'autre part, considérons que, dans la majorité des cas, l'Indien vit et meurt dans son village. A Chandernagor, sur 754 conjoints, nous n'en avons trouvé que 83 habitant, au moment du mariage, un village autre que celui de naissance.
A Oulgate, près de Pondichéry, sur 6340, on en trouve seulement 263."

"Nous en conclurons que si le jeune homme choisissait une épouse dans son village, il devrait prendre une proche parente. Or sa loi le lui défend."

Disparité N/S de l'Inde au niveau des loi:
Dans le nord on ne peut se marié jusqu'au 14ième degré et une homonymie de nom empêche tout mariage, même si l'on ne trouve aucun degré de parenté. --> Il y a les ghataks ou marieurs qui cherchent époux aux jeunes filles.
Dans le sud, on  peut se marier entre familles consanguines: un oncle peut épouser la fille de sa soeur, mais jamais celle de son frère. On se marie dans sa caste mais c'est toujours entre 20 ou 30 familles que se font tous les mariages; de sorte qu'une jeunne fille est, dès son berceau, destinée à un garçon qui peut demeurer des centaines  de lieues plus loin. Ce n'est que si les parents de celui-ci la refusent, qu'elle pourra songer à un autre mariage. --> favorise l'exogamie: une fois mariée la femme va vivre dans la famille du mari

Les hindous sont de rigoureux monogames: ils sont poly que si ils ne peuvent avoir d'enfants avec la premiere femme, cette dernière doit être d'accord pour que le mari en trouve une autre.

Le mariage est de rigueur, il y a que les fakirs qui peuvent s'en dispenser.

"Il ne faut pas qu'une jeune fille reste non mariée; c'est là un grand malheur pour une famille. On comprend, en effet, qu'une vieille fille, pour devenir femme, pourrait se résoudre à violer les distinctions de castes. Aussi, pour caser les vieilles filles, existe-t-il, dans chaque caste * une sous-caste « koulline » qui a droit à la polygamie.

  abstract = {ANGLAIS: Marriage is almost universal and girls get married at a very early age in India. Interstate variations in nuptiality patterns in India were studied in terms of 8 socioeconomic and demographic variables using multivariate approach. The methodology of the study and limitations of the result data are summarized. It was found that female nuptiality can be predicted with the following socioeconomic and demographic variables: 1) the percentage of females literate 2) percentage of female workers 3) proportion of single males to single females and 4) percentage of population living in urban areas. None of the variables was as successful in predicting male nuptiality. Female literacy was the best predictor of age at marriage and marriage rate for females with higher literacy rates being conducive to higher age at marriage and lower marriage rates in total.

Il a été constaté que la nuptialité féminine pouvait être prédite avec les variables socio-économiques et démographiques suivantes: 1) le pourcentage de femmes alphabètes 2) le pourcentage de travailleuses 3) la proportion d'hommes célibataires par rapport aux femmes célibataires et 4) le pourcentage de population vivant en zone urbaine. Aucune de ces variables ne permettait de prédire aussi bien la nuptialité masculine. L'alphabétisation des femmes était le meilleur prédicteur de l'âge au mariage et du taux de mariage chez les femmes, les taux d'alphabétisation les plus élevés favorisant un âge plus élevé au mariage et des taux de mariage plus faibles au total.},

For example, the singulate mean age at marriage of females increased from 15.2 in 1951 to 19.0 by 1991 (Bhat and Halli, 1999) and to 19.7 by 1998-1999 (IIPS and ORC Macro, 2000). Median age at first marriage was 18.1 for women in Tamil Nadu (IIPS, 1995).

Questions peu explorés:
Less is known about regional differences and trends in marriage patterns, such as endogamy, postmarital residence patterns, spousal age and educational differences, dowry, and the extent to which women have a say in determining timing and partner, on the one hand, and the disbursal of their dowries on the other. Also poorly understood is the extent to which changes in these patterns are conditioned by sociocultural factors such as region and religion and their association with female autonomy.

Objectifs du papier:
The intention of this chapter is to describe differences in marital age and patterns among successive marital age cohorts and explore the extent to which differences emerge by region and religion.

Résultats GLOBAUX sur le mariage:
Findings suggest that marriage patterns are by and large stable over time, but that practices are far less alienating or likely to limit exercise of autonomy among south Indian women, irrespective of age or religion, than among northern women.

Marriage-related decision making:
Marier sa fille est un des devoirs les plus importants pour un père autant dans le nord que dans le sud de l'Inde. Ni dans l'Uttar Pradesh, ni dans le Tamil Nadu le choix revient entièrement à la fille. Responses suggest that for the overwhelming majority, irrespective of marital duration, region, or religion, marriages were arranged either by parents alone or with relatives and matchmakers. 
Recently married cohorts exerted considerably more of a voice than older cohorts in marriage-related decision making. For example, among Hindu and Muslim women from Tamil Nadu, proportions reporting a say in marriage decisions increased from 37 and 29 percent, respectively, among the longer married cohort to 45 and 35 percent, respectively, among the recently married ones.

Kin Marriage and Premarital Acquaintance with Husband:
Regional differences in kin marriage and village exogamy have been extensively documented in the literature. In the north, and particularly among Hindus, the practice is to marry young girls into families with which previous contact has been limited and kin marriage is rare—both features that heighten women’s powerlessness (Committee on the Status of Women in India, 1973). In the south, in contrast, both Hindu and Muslim women enjoy less alienating marriage ties. Here, marriage is more a means of consolidating existing kinship networks than a political alliance, and as a result they are both more likely to be married within the wider kin network and to be acquainted with their husbands prior to marriage. 
Voir l'article de Régnault1891 qui parle de ça avec la consanguinité
These are cultural practices that are deeply embedded; there is no convincing evidence, for example, of change over time in either the extent of marriage within kin networks or of premarital acquaintance in all four communities.

Village Endogamy and Postmarital Residence:
In the more patriarchal kinship structure prevailing in the north, particularly among Hindus, marriage involves the incorporation of outsiders as wives into the family and the resulting village exogamy ensures a break between the natal family and the family into which a woman is married. In the south, in contrast, marriage is perceived as a means of strengthening existing community-level bonds, and this is ensured through village endogamy (Karve, 1965).
Voir l'article de Régnault1891 qui parle de ça avec la consanguinité
Correspondant aux conclusions concernant le mariage parental, les résultats suggèrent de grandes disparités régionales dans la pratique de l'endogamie villageoise sur le plan religieux, mesurées ici par la proportion de femmes qui résident actuellement dans les villages dans lesquels elles sont nées ou ont passé leur enfance. . L'endogamie villageoise est rarement rapportée chez les femmes hindoues de l'Uttar Pradesh (1 à 2%); elle concerne environ un sixième des femmes musulmanes dans ce contexte et atteint environ un tiers et demi des femmes hindoues et musulmanes du Tamil Nadu. Encore une fois, les changements spécifiques à la durée du mariage sont imperceptibles, ce qui suggère encore une fois que cette pratique traditionnelle reste la norme.
The overwhelming majority of women coresided with their husbands’ families immediately following marriage, although again, women from Tamil Nadu were somewhat less likely than those from Uttar Pradesh to have done so. Although in Tamil Nadu, this proportion has remained virtually unchanged over the two marriage cohorts studied.

Spousal Imbalances in Age and Education: Extent of Polygamy:
It is hypothesized that characteristics of the husband such as his age and education and particularly wide spousal age and educational disparities can further limit the autonomy of young married women. Spousal age differences are, in general, considerably wider in Tamil Nadu than in Uttar Pradesh, and these disparities persist even among younger cohorts. Even so, the evidence suggests a considerable narrowing of age differences among successive cohorts of Muslim women in both settings.

Dowry:
If the boy is well educated and from a good family, they [the bride’s family] may have to pay a higher dowry. According to today’s times, if we have to fix a marriage in a family like ours, we would have to spend Rs 10 lakh [US$32,000] on the entire marriage. (Jat,4 Meerut)
Voir l'article dans mon mémoire qui parle de la différenciation des femmes avec la dot (Becker, 1981).
In both settings, dowry amounts can be crippling and well out of proportion with the household’s income. Rupee values of dowry ranged from 0 for those whose marriages involved no dowry to Rs 110,000.
Findings suggest that dowry expenses have actually recorded moderate increases in all communities in recent years, and
 increases are particularly striking among younger marriage cohorts among the Hindus of Uttar Pradesh and the Muslims of Tamil Nadu.
Ce sont les bijoux qui représentent le truc le montant le plus élevé de la dot.
Nos données suggèrent que la très grande majorité des femmes du Tamil Nadu (86 à 90% chez les musulmans et 90 à 93% chez les hindous) affirment avoir eu leur mot à dire sur la manière dont ces articles ont été utilisés, et entre la moitié et les deux tiers ont déclaré eu le contrôle majeur sur eux.
In Tamil Nadu, women in the recently married cohort have about as much control over these valuables as does the cohort married 11 or more years. In general, however, the major divide continues to be regional rather than religion or marital duration.
Several hypotheses may be raised for this regional divide in dowry payments. For one, as Srinivas (1989) has suggested, there are two types of dowry, traditional and modern. In Tamil Nadu, where dowry transfers traditionally have been accepted, dowry transfers and content remain essentially traditional—payments include predominantly jewelry and gold
along with some household gifts, and are generally regarded as the property of women.
L'autre type est constitué d'argent et d'objets techno comme en Uttar Pradesh
Srinivas nous explique que la dot moderne order to attract better qualified and hence more desirable grooms in the marriage market.
Tamil Nadu, in contrast, is characterized by caste endogamy in which postmarital residence is often the natal village or vicinity. In this environment, the young woman has greater social and natal family support to maintain control of her property and valuables than in Uttar Pradesh, where she has no close allies. Finally, as we have maintained, women in Tamil Nadu have more autonomy in every sphere of their lives than do women in Uttar Pradesh, and control over dowry is no exception (see, e.g., Jejeebhoy, 2000; Jejeebhoy and Sathar, 2001).

Factors Contributing to Delayed Marriage:
D'une part: In fact, women’s economic independence has been hypothesized as the leading reason for delayed marriage in gender-stratified settings where families stand to gain from the employment of their uneducated daughters, but especially in more equal settings where the woman herself stands to gain (Caldwell, Reddy, and Caldwell, 1983; Jain and Nag, 1986; Mason, 1993; Salaff and Wong, 1977).
D'autre part: Others have argued differently, placing education more at the center of the force for change.
OLS: Findings suggest that not all blocks, and not all indicators within each block, play a role in influencing marriage age. Among individual-level factors, the role of education is prominent. In both settings and in both cohorts, even a primary school education has a significant effect on delaying marriage; there is some evidence that in Tamil Nadu, the influence of both a primary and a secondary education on delaying marriage has become stronger among the recently married cohort. At the same time, the effect of a secondary education is clearly far more pronounced in each group. In contrast, economic activity prior to marriage is unrelated to marriage age in each setting and cohort. Thus, having a say in marriage decisions does not appear to delay marriage.
Il n’existe aucune preuve que les personnes mariées à l’intérieur ou à proximité du village natal se marient plus tard que les autres femmes. En revanche, dans les deux cohortes du Tamil Nadu et, dans une moindre mesure, de la cohorte récemment mariée de l'Uttar Pradesh, les conclusions suggèrent que les femmes mariant des hommes considérablement plus âgés (5 ans ou plus) sont nettement plus susceptibles de se marier tôt que les autres femmes. Parmi les femmes plus âgées - mais pas les plus jeunes - du Tamil Nadu (mais pas de l'Uttar Pradesh), il est prouvé que les gros paiements en dot ont tendance à retarder le mariage.
CONCLUSION: Finally, the evidence suggests that sociocultural context—as measured by religion and setting—exerts a powerful influence on marriage age. A look at findings for the two states combined suggests that compared to the Muslims of Uttar Pradesh, the Hindus of this state marry significantly earlier, but both Muslims and Hindus from Tamil Nadu are significantly more likely to delay marriage. As shown in earlier tables, state rather than religion plays the more prominent role in explaining variation in age at marriage.

First, findings confirm that marriage has been increasing moderately and at different paces in the two states.
Second, a review of marriage practices suggests that practices are largely context dependent.
Third, findings confirm considerable similarity in determinants of marriage age in this region, though the magnitude of certain effects may vary.
Fourth, in contrast, findings suggest considerable heterogeneity in factors influencing dowry payments in the two settings.

These findings suggest that by and large, sociocultural setting and individual and marriage process-related factors have a powerful effect on determining marriage age and practices. What is not as clear is that these determinants have shifted over successive cohorts of women. Notably, findings suggest that although education plays a significant role in enhancing marriage age, it also tends to raise dowry payments. Conversely, although premarital economic activity is unrelated to marriage age, it plays a significant role in reducing dowry payments. These kinds of findings suggest that strategies to delay marriage and counter the practice of dowry need to expand beyond education or employment. More comprehensive, direct, and context specific strategies must be sought simultaneously—raising community awareness of the negative effects of early marriage and countering fears of allowing girls to remain single; providing for the acquisition of usable vocational and life skills; and enhancing young women’s real access to and control over economic resources and decision making relating to their own lives.},

  comment = {A transfer in the opposite direction, from grooms and their families to brides and their families, commonly found in polygamous societies with well-defined property rights, is generally called a bride price (Bergstrom, 1993)

Of the 1267 societies recorded in the Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas, twothirds practice bride price while only six per cent follow the custom of dowry (Murdock,1967).

Moreover,i t has been widely reportedi n the literaturet hat over the last fifty years not only has the size of dowry payments increased, communities that traditionally paid bride prices have also switched to paying dowries (Rao, 1993).

In contrast to the north, states in the south are characterized by endogamy (marriage between close relatives or notably cross cousins), isogamy (status equity between the bride's family and the groom's family), recognition of women's rights to land, and short distances of marriage migration. Bride price is relatively more common, and marriage expenses are likely to be more equally shared by the families of the bride and the groom (Dyson,and Moore, 1983; Miller, 1981). As women may sometimes inherit property rights in the south, a crucial difference between the two regions is that in the north, dowry consists of movable goods only, while in the south it may include land.


Pourquoi la dot persiste ? 

On peut dire que ca vient de la contribution des femmes au marché du travail agricole:

That is, the nature of marriaget ransactionsi s an outcome of sexual division of agricultural abor,a s high or low economic value of women is determinedb y their relative labor force participationr ates in agricultural production. Accordingly, dowries in north India are sometimes explained by its plough-based agricultural production of wheat (primarily), which excludes women from production, while bride price in the south is explained by the region's intensive ricegrowing economy, which is dependent on female labor (Miller, 1980). In sum, bride price regions typically have paddy cultivation and high female contribution to subsistence (Boserup, 1970).
However, Gulati (1975) and Schlegel and Eloul (1987) find that even regions characterized by low female labor contribution sometimes exhibit bride price as the common form of marriage payment. Moreover, the area of low female labor force participation stretches from Punjab to Assam (north India to east India). The southern state of Kerala also falls into this category. What is surprising about these states is that they include both wheat-producing areas (theoretically low female labor demand) as well as rice-producing areas (theoretically high female labor demand). One would therefore expect low and high female labor participation in the respective ecological regions on the basis of a simple demand theory, but this is not the case (Gulati, 1975; Harrell and Dickey, 1985). This suggests that there are other factors that affect female labor from participating in agricultural activities and therefore broad conclusions about geographical distribution of bride price and dowry cannot be totally derived from the dominant mode of production in a society.


Ca peut aussi venir du fait que la société est socialement stratifiée:
It has also been noted that there exists a close correlation between class, caste or socioeconomic position and marriage transactions in India (Goody, 1973; Miller, 1981). It is held that the custom of dowry is more prevalent in the upper caste and classes, while bride price or reciprocity is more frequent in the lower caste and division of society (Dickemann, 1991; Gaulin and Boster, 1990; Stone and James, 1995).},
