% Nouvelle organisation de la revue, sûrement meilleure
% \begin{itemize}

% \item[P1] Aucun articles ne s'est intéressé à ça en Inde (ni même dans les PED) (en Inde il y a \cite{Michiels2021} qui regardent cognitive sur labour mobility) alors que l'endettement des ménages est colossal et que c'est un sujet super chaud: literature

Since more than a decade, there has been increasing interest in psychology in economics literature\footnote{In 2020, we find more than 200 articles in economics with ``Cognitive skills'' or ``Personality traits'' in the title, asbtract or keywords while there are less than 40 in 2009 -- Scopus data. Accessed June 29, 2021.}, especially through personality traits and cognitive skills (PT\&CS).
The relevance of such analysis in economics is well documented in the literature.
\cite{Hanushek2008} shows that cognitive skills are correlated with individual earnings, distribution of income and economic growth.
Moreover, other factors such as well-functioning economic institutions --although enter into growth and may well have stronger effects, may also amplify the effects of cognitive skills.
% Authors add that the current situation in developing countries is much worse than generally pictured on the basis just of school enrollment and attainment.
Concerning personality traits, \cite{Borghans2008} examines, for instance, the relevance of personality traits in economics.
They show that psychological variables are a good predictor of socioeconomic success (especially on labour market\footnote{See \cite{Almlund2011}.}) \dev{and they can be influenced by interventions and investment more readily than IQ after the early years because of the non-stability through life cycle.}
Thus, institutions such as World Bank collecting more and more data\footnote{As stated by \cite{Laajaj2019b}, the World Bank alone spent 1 billion USD a year.} because it enable a ``better understanding of skill requirements in the labor market, backward linkages between skills acquisition and educational achievement, personality, and social background, and forward linkages between skills acquisition and living standards, reductions in inequality and poverty, social inclusion, and economic growth'' \citep{STEP2014}.



\paragraph{Definition}
Cognitive skills can be defined as a ``term that refers to mental processes involved in the acquisition of knowledge, manipulation of information, and reasoning [that] include the domains of perception, memory, learning, attention, decision making, and language abilities'' \citep{Kiely2014}.
While ``personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his characteristics behavior and thought'' \citep{Allport1961}.
Among the theories of personality, the traits can be defined as thought, emotion and habitual patterns of behavior \citep{Kassin2003}.
The Big-5 model constitute the main personality trait taxonomy.
Based on \cite{Goldberg1981} and \cite{McCrae1987} works, it identify five dimensions of personality: neuroticism (or emotional stability), \ie~the capacity to experience negative emotions; extraversion, \ie~the capacity to experience positive emotions, the tendency to seek stimulation and company from others; openness to experience, \ie~``one’s capacity to be creative and unstructured versus one’s tendency to need structure and clarity'' \citep{Piedmont2014}; agreeableness, \ie~``perceptions of others that are caring, compassionate, and altruistic versus manipulative, self-serving, and antagonistic'' \citep{Piedmont2014}; conscientiousness, \ie~the capacity to display self-discipline, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations.	

\paragraph{Skills in economics}
Studies in economics\footnote{For a comprehensive review, see \cite{Almlund2011}.} focuses on the role of skills on labour market and especially on income gap, performance at work and type of work or education through  educational attainment, course grades or standardized achievment test (SAT) scores but few researcher have been interested in the relationship with household finances while it is a growing area of interest\footnote{This renewed interest led the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) to create a field in its own right under the code G5.}.
[Indeed] Household are more implicated in financial decision such as privatization of retirement pension, liberalization of loan market, increase in credit purchase, which are more complicated because of financial innovation \citep{Guiso2013}.

The few studies that have focused on household finance mainly investigate four outcomes: risk aversion, financial distress, savings and debt.
\cite{Nga2013} show that conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness are correlated with risk aversion, cognitive biases and socially responsible investing for undergraduate students of Malaysia.
For 4,026 individuals from Netherland, \cite{Pinjisakikool2017} shows that all the Big-5 personality traits are good predictor of financial risk tolerance as \cite{Bucciol2017} that shows that agreeableness, cynical hostility and anxiety are good predictor of financial risk taking for 10,641 individuals from USA (negative correlation).
In terms of financial distress, \cite{Agarwal2013} shows that individuals with high math scores are less likely to make financial distress in USA.
\cite{Parise2019} are one of the first who deal with causality instead of correlation.
Using instrumental variable method\footnote{They instruments conscientiousness and emotional stability with shock during childhood \dev{à vérifier}.} on Dutch dataset, they shows that people in the bottom quintile of personality traits are 10 times more likely to experience financial distress than those in the top quintile.
Concerning saving behaviour, \cite{Gerhard2018} decompose 3,382 individuals from United-Kingdom in two groups (striving and established) and find that agreeableness is negatively correlated with total household savings for both groups and the effect is stronger for the striving than for the established.
\cite{Nyhus2001} shows that extraversion is negatively correlated with savings for 1,266 individuals from Netherland and in interesting in debt, they shows that emotional stability is positively correlated with debt.
Still with debt, \cite{Brown2014} shows that extraversion and agreeableness are positively associated with the level of debt held while conscientiousness is negatively correlated with the level of unsecured debt for 10,000 individuals of United-Kingdom and \cite{Forlicz2019} shows differences between debtors and debt-free individuals in terms of conscientiousness, honesty, attittude towards money and shoppping for 3,711 individuals from Poland, Spain, Romania and Italy.

Other research build a bridge between household finance and individual skills through the notion of financial literacy\footnote{Financial literacy measure ``how well an individual can understand and use personal finance-related information'' \citep{Huston2010}.} \citep{Hastings2013} \citep{Gaurav2012} \citep{Klapper2012}
\dev{Developper ? Pas sûr}

\paragraph{Indebtedness in India}
To our knowledge, no articles has looked at personality traits and cognitive skills on debt in India\footnote{\cite{Michiels2021} intersting in the role of personality traits on labour mobility in rural Tamil Nadu.} (nor even in developing countries) while the indian context is unique in terms of household finance.
Since the 80's, the incidence of indebtedness increase for rural and urban households (respectively from 19 to 32\% and from 17 to 22\%) with an increasing in the share of household indebted to formal (or institutional) sources (11 to 17\%) and informal sources\footnote{In part due to the economic and financial sector reforms of 1991: \url{http://indiabefore91.in/1991-economic-reforms}.} (10 to 19\%) \citep{Rajakumar2019}.
As we discuss in section \ref{subsection:data}, this number is largely under-estimate \citep{Jones1994} and micro-level studies indicates incidence of debt around 80-90\% \citep{Guerin2013a, Jones1994, Dreze1997, Reboul2021}.
The average amount of debt per household strongly increased between 1951 and 2012 (from 83 INR to 32,522 INR) with an increasing in the share of formal debt (from 7 to 56\% for rural households) and, thus, a decreasing in the share of traditional informal debt (from 93 to 43\% for rural households) \citep{Rajakumar2019}.

% Farmers suicid : \citep{Nair2011, Sriram2010}

% Why majo of informel ? \cite{Badarinza2016b}
% 1. car les terres et les maisons s'héritent : \citep{Badarinza2016b} avancent que cela peut provenir de la « prédominance des ménages multigénérationnels, dans lesquels les terres et les propriétés résidentielles constituent une part importante des legs » donc pas beaucoup besoin d'emprunt formel. 4\% des ménages dont le chef a moins de 35 ans ont un prêt hypothécaire ce qui est nettement inférieur à la situation des autres pays émergents comme la Chine \citep{Badarinza2016b}.
% 2. Pénétration bancaire très hétérogène : \citep{Badarinza2016b} et \citep{Burgess2005} : les États ayant un taux de pénétration bancaire élevé sont ceux où les ménages sont les moins dépendants de l’endettement non institutionnel.

%D'après \citep{Badarinza2016b}, la proba de contracter une dette informelle se réduit avec le niveau d'éducation: [l]es ménages dont au moins un membre a fait des études supérieures ou des études de troisième cycle ont une dette hypothécaire supérieure de 15,1\% par rapport au groupe des personnes peu instruites et une part de dette non institutionnelle inférieure de 28,7\%.

%Paysage financier de \cite{Guerin2012a} for informal debt and reasons of debt: beaucoup de cérémonies, beaucoup de survie quotidienne.

Added to this is a high level of inequalities in terms of indebtedness.
\cite{Guerin2013a} show that the caste affect borrowing strategies as amount, type and source of debt in rural Tamil Nadu, India.
Dalits, have higher incidence of indebtedness but borrow smaller amounts and more frequently from ambulant lenders \citep{Guerin2013a}.
They borrow less for economic reason than non-dalits but more for household expenditures \citep{Guerin2013a, Guerin2014a}.
Finally, they have the lower access\footnote{In part, because of they does not have necessary guarantee (i) such as good land (irrigated one and good location), specific know-how (ii), or because they self-excluded themselves because dalits are persuaded to fail \citep{Guerin2013a}.} to bank loans while it offer ``the best conditions financially speaking'' (low interest rate, higher amounts, long duration) \citep{Guerin2013a, Chavan2007}.

Disparities is also important through the gender.
\cite{Reboul2021} show that the relative amount of debt is higher for female than for male while male earn much more.
Moreover, female in the poorest households have the highest borrowing responsibilities and dalit female tend to face higher debt burdens than non-dalit one.
In terms of use, male borrow more for economic investment while female more for daily survival and debt repayment \citep{Reboul2021}.

%	% ******************************
%	\subsubsection{Social meaning of debt}
%	% ******************************
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Question de la confiance très présente dans la dette :
%\cite{Guerin2014a} Households’ creditworthiness is above all a matter of trust (nambikai), the term used locally
%when people refer to their ability to access credit. The fabric of trust covers many aspects that
%far exceed good credit history and repayment behaviour, and relates to every aspect of the
%borrowers’ reputation. Creditworthiness is rarely assessed on the individual level, and often
%incorporates the reputation and morality of the whole family or even lineage (Harriss-White
%and Colatei 2004). Lenders often state that they take two levels into account. One relates to
%family and lineage (taradaram), namely the family’s history, its “ethical” background and
%“morality”. The second level is individual (daram), relating very broadly to the “quality” of a
%person. It is therefore perfectly rational that the poor attach an equal importance to their
%reputation.
%
%“Behavior” also matters. As previously discussed, low castes are often seen as risky
%borrowers. Irrespective of caste, bad habits such as laziness, alcoholism and gambling are
%considered as indicators of poor repayment potential. As discussed above, respect and deference are also highly valued. Potential borrowers should equally show respect to their
%lenders and at times to its community.
%Giving money is a matter of respect. I respect them, they should respect me. How could I give them
%money if they talk badly about me? (Rajagopalan, Reddiar [FC], landowner and lender).
%If you don’t want credit from a particular community, then you can talk about them to others; otherwise
%you should not criticize. It might spoil creditworthiness. We should talk respectfully about these people,
%this is the only way to get creditworthiness (Gundusammy, Goundar (MBC), agriculture coolie and
%marginal farmer).
%
%\item Rapport de force
%\cite{Guerin2014}
%
%\citep{Guerin2020a}
%inseparable from an overall set of interdependencies, protection and social differentiation
%
%\item Social and moral experience
%imbued with subjectivities, felt-obligations and also aspirations
%
%\item Prestige sociale
%\cite{Guerin2014a}
%To understand debt practices, motivations and rationales, however, it is necessary to examine
%how the poor perceive and experience debt. It also requires taking into account the diversity
%of debt meanings and debt relationships. Of those in extremely vulnerable financial situations,
%very few consider themselves as over-indebted. The contrast between exogenous
%categorisations and local subjectivities is striking. One could of course argue that the poor
%suffer from “false consciousness”, in the sense that they are not even able to assess their own
%exploitation. Our explanation is different: we argue that the poor have their own “frameworks
%of calculations” (Villarreal 2009; this volume) and debt hierarchies (Shipton 2007). Such
%phenomena transcend questions of material or self-centred motivations and reflect issues of
%status, honour, power, and individual and group identity. This is our second argument:
%individuals engage multiple criteria to establish debt hierarchies and to evaluate debt burdens.
%Though financial criteria certainly matter, the social meaning of debt is equally, or more
%valued. While some debts are dishonoring, others are not. This depends upon the social
%relation between the debtor and the creditor and their respective status. Caste, class, kin and
%gender relationships are instrumental here.
%
%\cite{Guerin2014}
%Firstly, the social meaning of debt clearly matters. Debt is a marker of social hierarchy in
%kinship groups, the neighborhood and community alike. People try to avoid debts degrading
%to their status, or at least try to pay back these debts first.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%\cite{Guerin2014a} : What is however clear is that over-indebtedness as a concept has little meaning to the poor.
%Financial indicators are certainly useful (and will be used here) to quantify the cost of debt.
%

\paragraph{Individual debt and public policies}

(demonetisation \cite{GuerinDemo2017} and lockdown \cite{Guerin2020})

\begin{itemize}
\item Financial inclusion : more and more HH are financial included \citep{Badarinza2019}, especially in India \citep{Chakravartya2013}. \dev{Literature Isabelle}
\item Secondly, on a vue que quasi tout le monde est concernés par la dette et especially to consume which is an determinants of global wealth (expenditures approach of GDP).
In India, the households and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) final consumption expenditure represent 60.29\% of GDP\footnote{World Bank Data -- \url{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PRVT.ZS?locations=IN}. Accessed January 22, 2021.}.
\item Household finance has faced a renewed interest since a decade \citep{Guiso2013}.
Indeed, household are more implicated in financial decision such as privatization of retirement pension, liberalization of loan market, increase in credit purchase, which are more complicated because of financial innovation\footnote{For a comprehensive review on the subject, see \cite{Tufano2003}.}.
Household finance (or consumer finance for researchers in business sciences) refer to the way that ``households use financial instruments to attain their objectives'' \citep{Campbell2006}.
More precisely\footnote{For a comprehensive review on household finance, see \cite{Tufano2009} for whom household finance is ``the study of how institutions provide goods and services to satisfy the financial functions of households, how consumers make financial decisions, and how government action affects the provision of financial services'', \cite{Guiso2013}, or \cite{Xiao2020}.}  its a ``research field to study how financial institutions provide products and services to meet financial needs of consumers, how consumers make financial decisions, how government agencies regulate financial institutions and protect financial consumers and how science and technology help optimize the efficiency of consumer finance markets and improve social welfare'' \citep{Xiao2020}.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Strengh of social identity}

More recently, several works highlight disparities between caste and gender in terms of aspirations.
\cite{Mukherjee2017} show that ``gender and caste primes can significantly affect long run aspirations and beliefs''. 
\cite{Alvi2019} use priming\footnote{Priming, in cognitive psychology, is ``the effect in which recent experience of a stimulus facilitates or inhibits later processing of the same or a similar stimulus.'' -- \url{https://dictionary.apa.org/priming}. Accessed June 21, 2021.} to study the effect of identity salience on aspirations.
They find that ``when women are primed on gender, they exhibit higher aspirations for their daughters [and] low-case  women primed on caste are more aspirational for their daughters''.
Finally, \cite{Sarkar2020} show that caste and gender work as double jeopardy instead of intersectionality for aspirations.
Indeed, ``the most socially disadvantaged groups -- Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Scheduled Caste (SC) -- have significantly lower income aspiration when compared to Other Backward Class (OBC) and Other Caste (OC) partiipants'' [and] [f]emale participants also have significantlty lower aspiration than their male counterparts''.
Moreover, SC/ST female participants have lower income aspiration levels compared to other groups.

Beyond being a source of inequality, caste and gender seems to deeply impact individuals by conditionning them.
In this context it appears important to investigate the role of PT\&CS on indebtedness in take into account the deepness of this social identity.
% For that, we use sub-sampling technic and we analyse the role of cognitive skills into this specific social identity.
% We create four group of individual : female dalits (i); male dalits (ii); female middle and upper class (iii); male middle and upper class (iv). 
% Three groups on four appears to be socially disadvantaged and one support the double jeopardy (DJ) thanks to \cite{Sarkar2020} (see Table \ref{tab:subsampling}).


\paragraph{Problematic, contribution and plan}
In a context where indebtedness is omnipresent but at different level according to social identity, study the relationship with PT\&CS appears full of meaning.
In this article we investigate how PT\&CS shape indebtedness situation (i), how the evolution of debt is correlated with the evolution of PT\&CS (ii).
More finely, we try to capture the weight of social identity by investigating the contribution of PT\&CS for each social groups on the shape of debt and the variation of debt (iii).
In other word, in a highly sensitive country to social identity, do individuals manage to differentiate themselves by their skills?

By providing descriptive and econometric empirical insights, this paper contributes to furthering our understanding of the determinants of individual indebtedness --which is rare and valuable in developing countries, as well as, contributing more generally to the expanding literature exploring the implications of PT\&CS for economic outcomes.

The rest of the article is organised as follow: section 2 is devoted to data and methodology, then, in section 3 we discuss some descriptive statistics to highlight the weight of social identity before exploring and discussing the relationship between PT\&CS and indebtedness in section 4.

% ******************************
\section{Data and methodology}
% ******************************


	% ******************************
	\subsection{Data}
	\label{subsection:data}
	% ******************************

Our empirical analysis is based on the NEEMSIS-1 \& NEEMSIS-2 (Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities and Skills in India Survey) surveys carried out respectively in 2016-17, and 2020-21 \citep{NEEMSISreport, NEEMSIS2017}.
This survey was the second and third waves of a longitudinal data collection project start in 2010 with RUME (RUral Microfinance and Employment survey) project in ten villages of Tamil Nadu.
Located in the Cuddalore and Villupuram districts, a mostly agricultural area, economies benefits from the proximity of two large industrial towns (Neyveli and Cuddalore) and a regional business center (Panruti).

RUME randomly selected 405 households using stratified sample framework based on three dimensions: proximity to small towns (Panruti, Villupuram and Cuddalore), an agro-ecological criterion, and caste affiliation.
Thus, half of villages are irrigated (the other half have dry lands) and within villages, half of the sample was selected from the mostly upper and middle caste part of the village (Ur) while the other half from the Colony part, where dalits (the ex-untouchables)  mainly live. 
NEEMSIS1 recovered 388 households (4.19\% attrition rate) and randomly selected 104 news households (for a total of 492 households) from these 10 villages, based on the same method. 
%Given that some households had migrated elsewhere between the 2010 and 2016-17 sampling periods (13\% of the recovered households).
NEEMSIS2 recovered 485 households (1.42\% attrition rate) from 2016-17 and recovered 10 households from 2010 that were not recovered in 2016-17.
Moreover, 100 news households were randomly selected (for a total of 595 households).

%While RUME survey focus on employment, migration and remittances, financial practices (such as loans, savings, lending practices, gold), agriculture, consumption and housing at household level, a new individual questionnaire have been added to NEEMSIS.
In NEEMSIS1 \& NEEMSIS2, two household members, called ``ego 1'' (mostly household questionnaire respondent) and ``ego 2'' (one younger household member randomly selected on a criterion of age), are directly addressed individual questionnaires that provide for instance a range of information on cognitive skills and personality traits.

NEEMSIS's surveys stands out from other Indian data sources such as the All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), as it has the rare and valuable advantage of recording debt at the individual level (identifying the person who went to the lender and borrowed in her own name).

Concerning the reliability, the great expertise of the team\footnote{Some members of the research team are present since more than twenty-year on the region for numerous quantitative and qualitative surveys.}, helped to formulate questions appropriately.
This for instance involved using particular terms that are less degrading than the generic term ``debt'' lists of the main local lenders, and asking indirect questions.
As stated by \cite{Reboul2021} (same data sets) ``[i]mproved data accuracy is for example reflected by an incidence of indebtedness found higher than in the estimates of the nation-wide AIDIS: 99\% of households are in debt in our case study, as opposed to 30\% in rural Tamil Nadu in 2012 according to the AIDIS \citep{NSSO2014}.'' 

Moreover, the moderate magnitude of the survey, compared to nationally representative datasets, ensures the high quality of the data and the tablet-based mode of data collection improved data quality in including constraints on answers to prevent inconsistencies. 

Our final sample consists of 473 households and 835 egos follows in 2016-17 and 2020-21.%ecause in 2016-17, two households does not have egos; and for 10 households all egos have changed between 2016-17 and 2020-21 (see Appendix \ref{app:data}).







	% ******************************
	\subsection{Construction of personality traits \& cognitive skills variables }
	% ******************************

As stated earlier, our survey allow us to construct measures of cognitive skills.
It include three score variables: literacy, numeracy, Raven\footnote{Raven test is ``a nonverbal test of mental ability consisting of abstract designs, each of which is missing one part. The participant chooses the missing component from several alternatives to complete each design.'' -- \url{https://dictionary.apa.org/ravens-progressive-matrices}. Accessed January 27, 2021.}.
These scores are construct in adding up the correct answers of a set of four questions for literacy and numeracy (six for 2020-21) test and 36 for Raven.

Concerning Big-5, on the basis of 35 questions, we averaged answers --based on a Likert scale from 1-``Almost Never'' to 5-``Almost always'', that belong to a determined trait after correcting for acquiescence bias\footnote{Acquiescence bias represent the ``tendency for survey respondents to agree with statements regardless of their content'' \citep{Lavrakas2008}.} (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}).
The resulting mean represent the score on each traits.

\citeauthor{McDonald1999}'s $\Upomega$\footnote{Literature on internal consistency estimators increasingly agrees that \citeauthor{Cronbach1951}'s $\upalpha$ --the most wide used estimator, is maybe not very efficient \citep{Bourque2019, TrizanoHermosilla2016}.}, a measure of internal consistency, are mostly satisfactory for 2016-17 data corrected from acquiescence bias: 0.81 for openness; 0.86 for conscientiousness; 0.59 for extraversion; 0.60 for agreeableness and 0.80 for emotional stability (see Figure \ref{fig:omega}).
For 2020-21, the internal validity after correcting for acquiesence bias is not ideal (see Figure \ref{fig:omega}) and implies that results could suffer from measurement error, which would bias our results towards zero.
We, therefore, implement our own exploratory factor analysis to identitfy personnality traits.

\label{fig:omega}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Factor analysis}
As warned by \cite{Laajaj2019}, the Big-Five taxonomy is limited in developing countries for several reasons: the enumerator-respondent interactions in face-to-face survey can induce a bias; the low education levels can make questions more difficult to understand and can induce a systematic response patterns, especially the acquiescence bias.

The very good knownledge of the field\footnote{More than 20 years.} allow us to collect data of high quality and avoid a bias due to misunderstanding of questions.
Moreover, we implement our own factor analysis of the 35 questions by principal component with promax rotation.
To avoid a bias in factor analysis, we do not corrected for acquiescence bias. % because it suppose that one reverse questions have the same meaning as one question.
In our dataset, acquiesence bias is measure with a set of reverse questions that are supposed perfectly opposed to another set of questions. 
However, the assumption of opposition is supportable only in the Big-5 taxonomy, in another layout pairs of questions can measure different aspects of personality.

The resulting factors for 2016-17 data are relatively similar to the Big-5 personality traits with satisfactory \citeauthor{McDonald1999}'s $\Upomega$: Factor 1 as Extraversion-Openness ($\Upomega=0.91)$; Factor 2 as Conscientiousness ($\Upomega=0.87)$; Factor 3 as Emotional stability-Conscientiousness ($\Upomega=0.76)$; Factor 4 as Emotional stability ($\Upomega=0.81)$ and Factor 5 as Agreeableness ($\Upomega=0.64)$ (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}).
The resulting factors for 2020-21 data are very different to the Big-5 taxonomy and to the 2016-17 factors: Factor 1 as Sociability (); Factor 2 as Conscientiousness (); Factor 3 as Emotional stability (); Factor 4 as () and Factor 5 as ().

\paragraph{Life-cycle effects}
To mitigate against the potential problem of life-cycle events --that might induce endogeneity through measurement error, we run univariate OLS regression with cognitive skills and personality traits as endogenous variables and age as exogenous variable. %(see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}).
We standardised the resulting residuals and use it at personality measures net of life cycle influences \citep{Nyhus2005, Brown2014}. 

\paragraph{Exogeneity}
The exogeneity of personality traits is well assume because of stability over time while there is no consensus in psychology \citep{Ardelt2000}.

According to \cite{Costa1997, McCrae2000} it remains stable, in part, because it is a genetic predisposition that, by definition, cannot be changed over life.
Many economist\footnote{But not all, see \cite{Borghans2008, Almlund2011, Heckman2011}. As stated by \cite{Heckman2011}, ``Personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life cycle. They are a possible avenue for intervention and policy.''} follow this path and the majority of then assume stability over time after the age of 25 and other verify this stability \citep{CobbClark2011}.

This stability refutes sociological and psychological literature which interesting in the influence of childhood and adulthood socialization on personality \citep{Mortimer1978, Moen1995}.
Following this path, \cite{Ardelt2000} state that ``personality can change over the course of a person's life, particularly if age at first measurement is low or over 50, if the retest interval is large, if individual personality aspects rather than the overall personality are considered, and if personality aspects other than the big five NEO traits are assessed.''

Our data allow us to examine stability over time of Big-5 personality traits for 835 individuals of rural India.
Calculating variation rate between 2016-17 and 2020-21 of each traits, results show a stability for minor part of the population.
Non-corrected traits, in addition to having globally (2016-17 and 2020-21) higher internal consistency (see Table \ref{fig:omega}) are less unstable over time without being able to relate stability: 50\% of egos have an absolut variation of Openness higher than 20\%, and higher than 15\% for other traits (see Appendix \ref{section:stab_big5}).

	\subsection{Indebtedness measures}
	% ******************************

Before exploring the role of cognitive skills and personality traits, it is necessary to discuss debt and over-indebtedness measures.
There is no consensus in the literature but three approaches are often retained \citep{Betti2007, Ferreira2000}.
Objective measures focus on the ability (or inability) to service or repay debts.
Typically, it is the debt to income ratio, debt to asset ratio, debt service ratio.
Over-indebtedness occurs when a certain threshold is exceeded.
Although this is the most widely used measure, it under-estimate the burden of debt in ousting personal feeling and sacrifice associated with debt and over-indebtedness \citep{Betti2007}.
 
Subjectives measure assume that ``individual households are the best judges of their own net debt/wealth position'' \citep{Betti2007}.
The robustness of the results are based on the degree of honesty and literacy of individuals that can make it, sometimes, less reliable \citep{Betti2007, DAlessio2013}.
As stated by \cite{Rinaldi2006} and \cite{Keese2012}, in general, objective measures align quite well with subjective measures at the household classification level.

Administrative measures treat indebtedness and over-indebtedness as ``all cases
where non-payment of debts have been registered officially or declared before a court'' \citep{Betti2007}.
In rural Indian context, this type of measures have little meaning since most of the debt is informal.

In order to best measure the debt, we could combine objective and subjective measures as \cite{Aniola2012} do in European Countries, but this brings the risk that all households will find themselves categorized as over-indebted according to the measure used \citep{Chichaibelu2018}.

It is recommended to analyse indebtedness at household level because generally income is grouped between household members \citep{European2010}.
However, in order to explore the role of individual characteristics such as personality and cognitive skills on indebtedness, we focus on three types of individual objective measures allowing us to understand the debt from three angles.

First, we investigate the size of the individual debt with the total amount of individual debt taken out in her own name.
Second, we investigate the burden of debt repayment with the individual debt service ratio\footnote{$DSR=\frac{Debt~service}{Annual~Income}$ which represent the share of income required to cover the repayment of interest and principal on a debt for one year.} (DSR).


% First, we wish to understand the role of personality traits \& cognitive skills on the incidence of individual debt --through the probability of being in debt\footnote{Dummy variable equal to 1 if the individual has some unsettled debt taken out in her own name, 0 otherwise.} in 2020-21.


	% ******************************
	\subsection{Econometric framework}
	\label{subsection:econometricframework}
	% ******************************

In order to better understand the relationship between debt and PT\&CS, our analysis takee place in two step.
\paragraph{How PT\&CS shape individual debt?}
In a first step, we use the PT\&CS of 2016-17 ($X'_{i}$) on individual debt of 2020-21 to understand how personality shapes individual debt.
Our analysis faces sample selection issues because of the nature of our dependent variables: the sample is restricted to those who declared a non-zero and non-missing debt.
We therefore do not account for entry and exit in debt by only considering total loan amount and debt service ratio.
To overcome this sample selection issue, we use a \cite{Heckman1976} model.
The household debt dependency ratios, defined as the number of indebtedness individuals divided by the total number of household members, in 2016-17 are used as exclusion restriction ($ER_{i}$) variables\footnote{The household debt dependency ratios is correlated with the probability, for an individual, of being indebted but not with the loan amount and the debt service ratio (see Appendix \ref{app:imr}).}, allowing to compute an inverse Mill’s ratio ($IMR_{i}$) to correct for selection in our equations of interest (eq. \ref{eq:ols}).
First, we use probit model with maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the probability for an individual of being in debt ($Indebt_{i}$) (eq. \ref{eq:probit}) and we clusterize the error at household level.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:probit}
\begin{split}
Indebt_{i}=\upbeta_{0}+X'_{i}*\upbeta_{1}+C'_{i}*\upbeta_{2}+Z'_{i}*\upbeta_{3}+\upbeta_{4}*ER_{i}+\upmu_{i}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Then, in order to investigate the amount of debt and the burden of repayment ($Y_{i}$), we use OLS with cluster at household level (eq. \ref{eq:ols}).
We do not use tobit model because our data are not censored or truncated, but defined on $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ \citep{Maddala1991}.
Despite the fact that Debt Service Ratio is a share, we do not use GLM beacuse of the upper bond of the variable ($>1$).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ols}
\begin{split}
Y_{i}=\upbeta_{0}+X'_{i}*\upbeta_{1}+C'_{i}*\upbeta_{2}+Z'_{i}*\upbeta_{3}+\upbeta_{4}*IMR_{i}+\upepsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{How does PT\&CS variation correlate with indebtedness variation?}
In a second step, we fully accept the non-stability of personality traits by using the variation of Big-5 personality traits ($X'_{it}$) through time (2016-17 and 2020-21) on debt evolution with fixed effect regressions (eq. \ref{eq:fe}). 
Unlike the previous approach (\textit{How PT\&CS shape individual debt?}), we do not use personality traits from factor analysis insofar as factor for 2016-17 are different from those for 2020-21. 
We use the same debt measures as before: the total amount of debt and the individual debt service ratio ($Y_{i}$).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fe}
\begin{split}
Y_{it}=\upbeta_{0}+X'_{it}\upbeta_{1}+C'_{it}\upbeta_{2}+Z'_{it}\upbeta_{3}+\upalpha_{i}+u_{it}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

An important caveat lies in the study of causality.
We do not pretend to show a causal relationshipt between PT\&CS and indebtedness but to relate correlations because we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality between PT\&CS variation and indebtedness variation.


\paragraph{Others variables and interpretation}
Our control variables ($C'_{it}$) are based on \cite{Reboul2021, Brown2014, Chichaibelu2017} which take the existing classic controls. 
We use two vector of variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual level variables as age; age square; dummy variable which take 1 if individual is the household head, 0 otherwise; main occupation\footnote{Define as the most time-consuming activity.}; number of occupation (dummy variable which take 1 if individual declare more than one occupation, 0 otherwise); dummy variable which take 1 if individual received formal education through school, 0 otherwise (no formal education) and a dummy variable for marital status (1 if married, 0 otherwise). 
\item Household level variables as monetary value of assets\footnote{The monetary value of assets includes gold; land; house; livestock; agricultural equipment and consumption good (car, computer, cookgas, phone, etc.).}; sex ratio; total annual income; household size; shock exposure (dummy variable which take 1 if the household experienced a shock\footnote{Marriage of at least one of the household members or/and household surveyed after the demonetisation.} between 2010 and 2016-17, 0 if not). 
\end{itemize}
In the first econometric approach (\textit{How PT\&CS shape individual debt?}), s our the amount of debt is estimated in $t+1$ and our independent variables in $t$, we therefore control for the indebtedness situation in $t$ in adding dummy variable which take 1 if individual is indebted in 2016-17, 0 otherwise.

To take into account the strength of social identity (gender and caste) we investigate relationship on a pooled sample of egos with interactions variables to maximize statistical power, although splitting samples improves model specification (the sub-samples obtained are too small to make regressions).
First we do not use interaction to see the global effect (1), then we add interaction variable with gender (2), caste (3) and both (4) to test wether the effect of PT\&CS differ by gender and caste :

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    (1)~~~~ $Z'_{i}=0$ & & & & (3)~~~~ $Z'_{i}=Caste*X'_{i}$ \\
    (2)~~~~ $Z'_{i}=Gender*X'_{i}$ & & & & (4)~~~~ $Z'_{i}=Gender*Caste*X'_{i}$ \\
    \end{tabular}%
\end{table}%

In all of our estimation (and specifications), we choose to cluster the error at households scale to take into account the fact that observations within each household are not i.i.d.
Indeed, we have data for two individuals from the same household and these latter sharing resources and pooling others.%\footnote{See \cite{Lazear1988} or \cite{Bonke2015} more recently.}.
In terms of debt, as stated by \cite{Reboul2021}, ``our data is limited, [but] it suggests that fully pooling and sharing the household debt burden is not the norm.''

To interpret our results, we compute marginal effect (ME) at representative values on the predicted values of PT\&CS \cite{Williams2012}.
We use gender (male/female) and caste (non-dalits/dalits) as representative values, all other variables are at mean.
Thanks to our interactions variables, we therefore obtains nine groups ME for each PT\&CS variable: average individual; average male; average female; average non-dalits; average dalits; average non-dalits male; average dalits male; average non-dalits female and average dalits female.

\section{Descriptive statistics}
% ***********************************

\subsection{Household unit in Table \ref{tab:descHH}}
Our final sample consists of 835 individuals from 473 households and almost half are dalits.
Three quarters of households have 2 egos, the last quarters have only one egos.
The sex ratio is significantly different through caste: in 24\% of dalits households there are as many men as women while in middle-upper caste, it is 34\% of households in 2016-17.
In terms of assets, middle-upper caste households are three times richer than dalits on average --respectively 1,493,350 INR and 487,420 INR in 2016-17.
50\% of middle-upper caste have less than 666,500 INR of assets while 50\% of dalits households have less than 266,400 INR in 2016-17.
For 50\% of dalits, the monetary value of assets increased by at least 47\% between 2016-17 and 2020-21 while for 50\% of non-dalits households, it decreased by at least 22\%.
However, middle and upper caste still have higher amount of assets in 2020-21.
This economic advantage of non-dalit households is also found with income: the median income of middle-upper caste is 33.71\% higher than dalits one in 2016-17 and 14.64\% higher in 2020-21.
Last, whatever the caste, we observe a reduction of total income: for 50\% dalits households the total income decreased by at least 3.55\% and for 50\% of non-dalits households, it decreased by at least 5.40\%.
		
\subimport{INPUT}{desc_HH.tex}

\subsection{Individual unit in Table \ref{tab:descindiv}}
At egos scale, 55.45\% of our sample are male (44.55\% are female) and among male, 46\% are dalit (among female 50\% are dalit).
Male are, on average, older than female and three quarters of them are the head of household while female are only 9\% in 2016-17 and 27\% in 2020-21.
This increase is partly due to the life cycle: when the household head died, the wife \dev{take over.}
In terms of education, male are more formal educated than female.

Disparities in terms of gender are found in the occupation.
Despite the increasing of the number of female in agriculture and the decreasing of the number of male in self-employment, this activities are mostly reserved for male.
The reverse assessment is true for salaried job in agriculture: between 2016-17 and 2020-21 the share of male increase by 47\% (from 16\% to 24\%) but female remain relatively more numerous (27.42\% in 2016-17 and 29.58\% in 2020-21). 
Whatever the gender, non-agricultural salaried job remain stable over time and the share of male implicated is similar to the share of female (around 37\%).
Non-income generating work as the main occupation is over-represented for female while even though the share fell considerably between 2016-17 and 2020-21 (from 24\% to 15\%).
Moreover, female are more likely to have multiple occupations and this probability increase between 2016-17 and 2020-21 (from 50\% to 60\%).
In terms of income, disparities persist between male and female.
On average, male have 102,000 INR per year as labour income while female have 19,000 INR.
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, the average variation rate is higher for female than for male (respectively 173\% and 163\%).

\paragraph{Individual debt trend}
There are also many disparities in terms of debt.
While the share of individual is relatively stable through time and gender (around 75\%), the path is different.
Female are more vulnerable than male in the sense that the share of individual never in debt is lower for female than for male (respectively 10\% and 14\%) and the share of individual becomes in debt between 2016-17 and 2020-21 is higher for female than for male (respectively 14\% and 8\%).
To finish with the path, we observe that more than six out of ten individuals remains indebted.

Our sample of indebted individual consists of 643 individuals in 2016-17 and 606 individuals in 2020-21 whose 516 are indebted in 2016-17 and in 2020-21.
Male have a higher absolute amount of debt than female (two times more in 2016-17: 190,000 INR for male while 80,000 INR for female) despite a reduction in the amount between 2016-17 and 2020-21 (for 50\% of male, debt has decreased by more than 57\%).
On the other hand, 50\% of female saw their debt increased by more than 24\% (on average, in 2016-17 a female has a debt of 80,000 INR, while it is at 90,000 INR in 2020-21.
Male spend less of their annual income on debt repayment than female: in 2016-17 50\% of male spend 27\% of their annual income on debt repayment and 12\% in 2020-21 while female spend 32\% in 2016-17 and 77\% in 2020-21.
Furthermore, 50\% of male have seen their DSR decreased by at least 0.27\% while 50\% of female have seen their DSR increased by at least 0.09\%.

\paragraph{Personality traits \& cognitive skills with Figures \ref{fig:PTCS}}

Figure \ref{fig:PTCS} shows the distribution of each personality traits net of life-cycle.
Middle-upper caste male tends to be more extraverted-openned than others (Factor 1).
For Conscientiousness (Factor 2), male have significant higher score than women, whatever the caste (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}, Table \ref{tab:anovaperso}).
Dalits tend to be more emotional stable and conscientiousness (Factor 3) than non-dalits
and dalits male more emotional stable than other (Factor 4).
For Agreeableness (Factor 5), we do not find significant differences between our four groups (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}, Table \ref{tab:anovaperso}).
In terms of cognitive skills, male tends to have higher score.

\subsection{How PT\&CS shape individual debt?}


Table \ref{tab:ame_indebt} presents the results from the multivariate probit analysis of the first stage of the Heckman procedure. 
The marginal effects (ME) at representative values on the predicted value of the PT\&CS are reported for the four specifications (without interaction, with gender interaction, with caste interaction, with gender \& caste interaction).


\subimport{INPUT}{AME_indebt.tex}

\begin{itemize}
\item All else being equal, one more point on the EXOP score reduces the probability of being in debt by 2.7 percentage points (pp).
\item For a female, all else being equal, one more point on the EXOP score reduces the probability of being in debt by 3.7 pp.
\item For a non-dalit individual, all else being equal, one more point on the EXOP score reduces the probability of being in debt by 6.5 pp.
\item For a non-dalit female, all else being equal, one more point on the EXOP score reduces the probability of being in debt by 8.5 pp.
\item[----]
\item For a female, all else being equal, one more point on the Conscientiousness score, reduces the probability of being in debt by 3.8 pp.
\item For a non-dalit male, all else being equal, one more point on the Conscientiousness score, increases the probability of being in debt by 6.9 pp.
\item For a non-dalit female, all else being equal, one more point on the Conscientiousness score, reduces the probability of being in debt by 6.4 pp.
\item[----]
\item For a non-dalit female, all else being equal, one more point on the ESCO, increases the probability of being in debt by 6.9 pp.
\item[----] 
\item For a dalit male, all else being equal, one more point on the Emotional Stability score, increases the probability of being in debt by 4.9 pp.
\item[----]
\item For a non-dalit individual, all else being equal, one more point on the Agreeableness score, reduces the probability of being in debt by 3.8 pp.
\item[----]
\item For a female, all else being equal, one more point at the Literacy test, increases the probability of being in debt by 3.8 pp.
\end{itemize}

Other things equal, among non-dalit female, those with higher EXOP have a lower probability of being in debt and those with higher Conscientiousness too (and the effect of EXOP is higher than the effect of Conscientiousness -- 2.1 pp more). 
However, non-dalit female with higher ESCO are more likely to be in debt than other non-dalit female.

% \subsection{Hypothesis}
% % ***********************************

% As we already note, the goal of this paper is to analyze the role of cognitive skills and personality traits on indebtedness in a context where \jati and gender conditionned individuals.


% firstly, check the contextual determinants of debt.
% Then, we add personality traits \& cognitive skills in the analysis to answer our first question: is cognitive skills and personality traits plays a significant role on indebtedness situation of households in rural India?
% Following literature, we can make H\ref{hyp:stability}.
% Indeed, concerning conscientiousness, \cite{Donnelly2012} state that ``highly conscientious individuals manage their money more because they have positive financial attitudes as well as a future orientation''.
% \cite{Brown2014, Nyhus2001} find similar results: conscientious individuals are less likely to have ever been in debt and conscientiousness is negatively related to the amount of unsecured debt.
% \cite{Nga2013} find that conscientiousness have a significant influence on risk aversion in Malaysia.
% \cite{Forlicz2019} find that for most of these countries there existed significant differences between debtors and debt-free individuals regarding the level of conscientiousness
% For neuroticism, \cite{Pinjisakikool2017b} find that emotional stability (inverse of neuroticism) significantly predict financial risk tolerance.

% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:stability}] \label{hyp:stability}
% Conscientiousness and neuroticism play significant role on household indebtedness [and over-indebtedness].
% \end{hyp}

% To understand the phenomenon more in depth, we decompose the analysis by caste, class and gender.
% The notion of class allow us to encompass ``property, wealth, occupation, income, and education'' \citep{Beteille2007}.
% We implement a multiple correspondance analysis with land property, wealth, occupation and income\footnote{We choose to not take into account education to stay at household level.} to create a dichotomy between high and low class (see appendix \ref{section:mca_class}).
% For caste and class decomposition, we formulate H\ref{hyp:poorer} imagining that cognitive skills are more important for lower households because we can imagine that higher one have all a high level of cognitive skills (math, literacy, etc.) because of better level of education\footnote{For the link between caste and education, see \cite{Borooah2005}.}.
% %\cite{Gaurav2012} find that cognitive skills significantly predict the financial aptitude and debt literacy for rural farmer in Gujarat
% %\cite{Agarwal2013} finds that ``consumers with higher math scores, are substantially less likely to make a financial mistake'' in separating our sample between economically and socially upper households and economically and socially lower households.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:poorer}] \label{hyp:poorer}
% Cognitive skills are better predictors for lower households than for higher one. 
% \end{hyp}

% Concerning gender, as \cite{Reboul2020} stated: ``[w]omen in the poorest households, despite meager incomes, have the highest borrowing responsibilities, shouldering the highest shares of household debt. [...] Their larger role in household debt management may be linked to their greater mobility and lower restrictions on social interactions, notably with men, which would underpin both their greater income shares and their access to credit relations. ''
% Thus, we can formulate the H\ref{hyp:women} hypothesis.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:women}] \label{hyp:women}
% When ego is a woman, her cognitive skills and personality traits play a bigger role in household finances than when ego is a man.
% \end{hyp}

% \cite{Reboul2019} Far beyond the issue of information about wages, the management of family finances leads
% to constant tensions and conflicts among family members, and thus gives rise to various tactics
% aimed at partially overcoming family constraints. This is particularly true for women, who have
% a heavy responsibility to ensure, among other things, daily expenses


% Last, we explore the source and use of debt in creating the dichotomy formal--informal and income generator--non-income generator of debt.
% Following results of \cite{Brown2014}, we formulate H\ref{hyp:filr}.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:filr}] \label{hyp:filr}
% Conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openess to experience have an association with informal debt.
% \end{hyp}

% To try to verify our hypotheses, we use original data set from rural south India.

%\paragraph{Retirement assets}
%Compared to China, the retirement pensions are not very efficient.
%Indeed, around 90\% of labor is informal [in the sense of absence of social insurance] and 85\% of non-agricultural workforce is informal \citep{Mehrotra2019}.
%For \cite{Badarinza2016b}, India figures as an outlier among low-middle-income countries on this point.
%\paragraph{Gold}

%\item On average, gold represent more than 11\% of indien household balance sheet  while it is less than 1\% in China \citep{Badarinza2016b}.

%\item Pourquoi ils aiment tant ?
%\item[1] Real estate has lower liquidity when compared with gold, and if liquidity needs are correlated with inflation volatility, gold better serves the purpose than real estate. Gold as a non-financial asset also has additional properties that are not provided for by real estate, such as a high collateral value and physical verifiability \citep{Badarinza2016b}
