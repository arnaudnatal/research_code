Since a decade, there has been increasing interest in psychology in economics literature\footnote{In 2020, we find more than 200 articles in economics with ``Cognitive skills'' or ``Personality traits'' in the title, asbtract or keywords while there are less than 40 in 2009 -- Scopus data. Accessed June 29, 2021.}, especially through personality traits and cognitive skills (PT\&CS).
Institutions --such as World Bank, are more and more interesting in collecting data on skills because it enable a ``better understanding of skill requirements in the labor market, backward linkages between skills acquisition and educational achievement, personality, and social background, and forward linkages between skills acquisition and living standards, reductions in inequality and poverty, social inclusion, and economic growth'' \citep{STEP2014}.

In the literature, \cite{Hanushek2008} for Cognitive skills and \cite{Almlund2011, Borghans2008, Heckman2011} for Personality traits

\paragraph*{Definition}
Cognitive skills can be defined as a ``term that refers to mental processes involved in the acquisition of knowledge, manipulation of information, and reasoning [that] include the domains of perception, memory, learning, attention, decision making, and language abilities'' \citep{Kiely2014}.
While ``personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his characteristics behavior and thought'' \citep{Allport1961}.
Among the theories of personality, the traits can be defined as thought, emotion and habitual patterns of behavior \citep{Kassin2003}.
The Big-5 model constitute the main personality trait taxonomy.
Based on \cite{Goldberg1981} and \cite{McCrae1987} works, it identify five dimensions of personality: neuroticism (or emotional stability), \ie~the capacity to experience negative emotions; extraversion, \ie~the capacity to experience positive emotions, the tendency to seek stimulation and company from others; openness to experience, \ie~``one’s capacity to be creative and unstructured versus one’s tendency to need structure and clarity'' \citep{Piedmont2014}; agreeableness, \ie~``perceptions of others that are caring, compassionate, and altruistic versus manipulative, self-serving, and antagonistic'' \citep{Piedmont2014}; conscientiousness, \ie~the capacity to display self-discipline, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations.	

\paragraph*{Skills in economics}
Studies in economics\footnote{For a comprehensive review, see \cite{Almlund2011}.} focuses on the role of skills on labour market and especially on income gap, performance at work and type of work or education through  educational attainment, course grades or standardized achievment test (SAT) scores but few researcher have been interested in the relationship with household finances while it is a growing area of interest\footnote{This renewed interest led the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) to create a field in its own right under the code G5.}.
[Indeed] Household are more implicated in financial decision such as privatization of retirement pension, liberalization of loan market, increase in credit purchase, which are more complicated because of financial innovation \citep{Guiso2013}.

The few studies that have focused on household finance mainly investigate four outcomes: risk aversion, financial distress, savings and debt.
\cite{Nga2013} show that conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness are correlated with risk aversion, cognitive biases and socially responsible investing for undergraduate students of Malaysia.
For 4,026 individuals from Netherland, \cite{Pinjisakikool2017} shows that all the Big-5 personality traits are good predictor of financial risk tolerance as \cite{Bucciol2017} that shows that agreeableness, cynical hostility and anxiety are good predictor of financial risk taking for 10,641 individuals from USA (negative correlation).
In terms of financial distress, \cite{Agarwal2013} shows that individuals with high math scores are less likely to make financial distress in USA.
\cite{Parise2019} are one of the first who deal with causality instead of correlation.
Using instrumental variable method\footnote{They instruments conscientiousness and emotional stability with shock during childhood \dev{à vérifier}.} on Dutch dataset, they shows that people in the bottom quintile of personality traits are 10 times more likely to experience financial distress than those in the top quintile.
Concerning saving behaviour, \cite{Gerhard2018} decompose 3,382 individuals from United-Kingdom in two groups (striving and established) and find that agreeableness is negatively correlated with total household savings for both groups and the effect is stronger for the striving than for the established.
\cite{Nyhus2001} shows that extraversion is negatively correlated with savings for 1,266 individuals from Netherland and in interesting in debt, they shows that emotional stability is positively correlated with debt.
Still with debt, \cite{Brown2014} shows that extraversion and agreeableness are positively associated with the level of debt held while conscientiousness is negatively correlated with the level of unsecured debt for 10,000 individuals of United-Kingdom and \cite{Forlicz2019} shows differences between debtors and debt-free individuals in terms of conscientiousness, honesty, attittude towards money and shoppping for 3,711 individuals from Poland, Spain, Romania and Italy.

Other research build a bridge between household finance and individual skills through the notion of financial literacy\footnote{Financial literacy measure ``how well an individual can understand and use personal finance-related information'' \citep{Huston2010}.} \citep{Hastings2013} \citep{Gaurav2012} \citep{Klapper2012}
\dev{Developper ? Pas sûr}

\paragraph*{Indebtedness in India}
To our knowledge, no articles has looked at personality traits and cognitive skills on debt in India\footnote{\cite{Michiels2021} intersting in the role of personality traits on labour mobility in rural Tamil Nadu.} (nor even in developing countries) while the indian context is unique in terms of household finance.
Since the 80's, the incidence of indebtedness increase for rural and urban households (respectively from 19 to 32\% and from 17 to 22\%) with an increasing in the share of household indebted to formal (or institutional) sources (11 to 17\%) and informal sources\footnote{In part due to the economic and financial sector reforms of 1991: \url{http://indiabefore91.in/1991-economic-reforms}.} (10 to 19\%) \citep{Rajakumar2019}.
As we discuss in section \ref{subsection:data}, this number is largely under-estimate \citep{Jones1994} and micro-level studies indicates incidence of debt around 80-90\% \citep{Guerin2013a, Jones1994, Dreze1997, Reboul2021}.
The average amount of debt per household strongly increased between 1951 and 2012 (from 83 INR to 32,522 INR) with an increasing in the share of formal debt (from 7 to 56\% for rural households) [and, thus, a decreasing in the share of traditional informal debt (from 93 to 43\% for rural households)] \citep{Rajakumar2019}.

% Farmers suicid : \citep{Nair2011, Sriram2010}

% Why majo of informel ? \cite{Badarinza2016b}
% 1. car les terres et les maisons s'héritent : \citep{Badarinza2016b} avancent que cela peut provenir de la « prédominance des ménages multigénérationnels, dans lesquels les terres et les propriétés résidentielles constituent une part importante des legs » donc pas beaucoup besoin d'emprunt formel. 4\% des ménages dont le chef a moins de 35 ans ont un prêt hypothécaire ce qui est nettement inférieur à la situation des autres pays émergents comme la Chine \citep{Badarinza2016b}.
% 2. Pénétration bancaire très hétérogène : \citep{Badarinza2016b} et \citep{Burgess2005} : les États ayant un taux de pénétration bancaire élevé sont ceux où les ménages sont les moins dépendants de l’endettement non institutionnel.

%D'après \citep{Badarinza2016b}, la proba de contracter une dette informelle se réduit avec le niveau d'éducation: [l]es ménages dont au moins un membre a fait des études supérieures ou des études de troisième cycle ont une dette hypothécaire supérieure de 15,1\% par rapport au groupe des personnes peu instruites et une part de dette non institutionnelle inférieure de 28,7\%.

%Paysage financier de \cite{Guerin2012a} for informal debt and reasons of debt: beaucoup de cérémonies, beaucoup de survie quotidienne.

Added to this is a high level of inequalities in terms of indebtedness.
\cite{Guerin2013a} show that the caste affect borrowing strategies as amount, type and source of debt in rural Tamil Nadu, India.
Dalits (ex-intouchable, the most persecuted group?), have higher incidence of indebtedness but borrow smaller amounts and more frequently from ambulant lenders \citep{Guerin2013a}.
They borrow less for economic reason than non-dalits (middle and upper caste) but more for household expenditures \citep{Guerin2013a, Guerin2014a}.
Finally, they have the lower access\footnote{In part, because of they does not have necessary guarantee (i) such as good land (irrigated one and good location), specific know-how (ii), or because they self-excluded themselves because dalits are persuaded to fail \citep{Guerin2013a}.} to bank loans while it offer ``the best conditions financially speaking'' (low interest rate, higher amounts, long duration) \citep{Guerin2013a, Chavan2007}.

Disparities is also important through the gender.
\cite{Reboul2021} show that the relative amount of debt is higher for female than for male while male earn much more.
Moreover, female in the poorest households have the highest borrowing responsibilities and dalit female tend to face higher debt burdens than non-dalit one.
In terms of use, male borrow more for economic investment while female more for daily survival and debt repayment \citep{Reboul2021}.

	% ******************************
	\subsubsection{Social meaning of debt}
	% ******************************
\begin{itemize}
\item Question de la confiance très présente dans la dette :
\cite{Guerin2014a} Households’ creditworthiness is above all a matter of trust (nambikai), the term used locally
when people refer to their ability to access credit. The fabric of trust covers many aspects that
far exceed good credit history and repayment behaviour, and relates to every aspect of the
borrowers’ reputation. Creditworthiness is rarely assessed on the individual level, and often
incorporates the reputation and morality of the whole family or even lineage (Harriss-White
and Colatei 2004). Lenders often state that they take two levels into account. One relates to
family and lineage (taradaram), namely the family’s history, its “ethical” background and
“morality”. The second level is individual (daram), relating very broadly to the “quality” of a
person. It is therefore perfectly rational that the poor attach an equal importance to their
reputation.

“Behavior” also matters. As previously discussed, low castes are often seen as risky
borrowers. Irrespective of caste, bad habits such as laziness, alcoholism and gambling are
considered as indicators of poor repayment potential. As discussed above, respect and deference are also highly valued. Potential borrowers should equally show respect to their
lenders and at times to its community.
Giving money is a matter of respect. I respect them, they should respect me. How could I give them
money if they talk badly about me? (Rajagopalan, Reddiar [FC], landowner and lender).
If you don’t want credit from a particular community, then you can talk about them to others; otherwise
you should not criticize. It might spoil creditworthiness. We should talk respectfully about these people,
this is the only way to get creditworthiness (Gundusammy, Goundar (MBC), agriculture coolie and
marginal farmer).

\item Rapport de force
\cite{Guerin2014}

\citep{Guerin2020a}
inseparable from an overall set of interdependencies, protection and social differentiation

\item Social and moral experience
imbued with subjectivities, felt-obligations and also aspirations

\item Prestige sociale
\cite{Guerin2014a}
To understand debt practices, motivations and rationales, however, it is necessary to examine
how the poor perceive and experience debt. It also requires taking into account the diversity
of debt meanings and debt relationships. Of those in extremely vulnerable financial situations,
very few consider themselves as over-indebted. The contrast between exogenous
categorisations and local subjectivities is striking. One could of course argue that the poor
suffer from “false consciousness”, in the sense that they are not even able to assess their own
exploitation. Our explanation is different: we argue that the poor have their own “frameworks
of calculations” (Villarreal 2009; this volume) and debt hierarchies (Shipton 2007). Such
phenomena transcend questions of material or self-centred motivations and reflect issues of
status, honour, power, and individual and group identity. This is our second argument:
individuals engage multiple criteria to establish debt hierarchies and to evaluate debt burdens.
Though financial criteria certainly matter, the social meaning of debt is equally, or more
valued. While some debts are dishonoring, others are not. This depends upon the social
relation between the debtor and the creditor and their respective status. Caste, class, kin and
gender relationships are instrumental here.

\cite{Guerin2014}
Firstly, the social meaning of debt clearly matters. Debt is a marker of social hierarchy in
kinship groups, the neighborhood and community alike. People try to avoid debts degrading
to their status, or at least try to pay back these debts first.

\end{itemize}


\cite{Guerin2014a} : What is however clear is that over-indebtedness as a concept has little meaning to the poor.
Financial indicators are certainly useful (and will be used here) to quantify the cost of debt.

\item Household finance has faced a renewed interest since a decade \citep{Guiso2013}.
Indeed, household are more implicated in financial decision such as privatization of retirement pension, liberalization of loan market, increase in credit purchase, which are more complicated because of financial innovation\footnote{For a comprehensive review on the subject, see \cite{Tufano2003}.}.
Household finance (or consumer finance for researchers in business sciences) refer to the way that ``households use financial instruments to attain their objectives'' \citep{Campbell2006}.
More precisely\footnote{For a comprehensive review on household finance, see \cite{Tufano2009} for whom household finance is ``the study of how institutions provide goods and services to satisfy the financial functions of households, how consumers make financial decisions, and how government action affects the provision of financial services'', \cite{Guiso2013}, or \cite{Xiao2020}.}  its a ``research field to study how financial institutions provide products and services to meet financial needs of consumers, how consumers make financial decisions, how government agencies regulate financial institutions and protect financial consumers and how science and technology help optimize the efficiency of consumer finance markets and improve social welfare'' \citep{Xiao2020}.
\end{itemize}





% ******************************
\subsection{Conditioned individuals through caste and gender with aspirations}
% ******************************
More recently, several works highlight disparities between \jati ~and gender in terms of aspirations.
\cite{Mukherjee2017} show that ``gender and caste primes can significantly affect long run aspirations and beliefs''. 
\cite{Alvi2019} use priming\footnote{Priming, in cognitive psychology, is ``the effect in which recent experience of a stimulus facilitates or inhibits later processing of the same or a similar stimulus.'' -- \url{https://dictionary.apa.org/priming}. Accessed June 21, 2021.} to study the effect of identity salience on aspirations.
They find that ``when women are primed on gender, they exhibit higher aspirations for their daughters [and] low-case  women primed on caste are more aspirational for their daughters''.
Finally, \cite{Sarkar2020} show that caste and gender work as double jeopardy instead of intersectionality for aspirations.
Indeed, ``the most socially disadvantaged groups -- Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Scheduled Caste (SC) -- have significantly lower income aspiration when compared to Other Backward Class (OBC) and Other Caste (OC) partiipants'' [and] [f]emale participants also have significantlty lower aspiration than their male counterparts''.
Moreover, SC/ST female participants have lower income aspiration levels compared to other groups.
Thus, beyond being a source of inequality, \jati and gender seems to deeply impact individuals by conditioning them.
More than an fregmentation and more than sources of dispartities, caste and gender seems to deeply impact social identities of individuals in India.
Indeed, it seems to conditionned individuals, it is part of their identity that affect action deep inside them as determine their aspirations.
In this context it appears important to analyse the role of personality traits \& cognitive skills on debt in take into account the deepness of this social identity.
% For that, we use sub-sampling technic and we analyse the role of cognitive skills into this specific social identity.
% We create four group of individual : female dalits (i); male dalits (ii); female middle and upper class (iii); male middle and upper class (iv). 
% Three groups on four appears to be socially disadvantaged and one support the double jeopardy (DJ) thanks to \cite{Sarkar2020} (see Table \ref{tab:subsampling}).

\section{Data and methodology}
% ******************************


	% ******************************
	\subsection{Data}
	\label{subsection:data}
	% ******************************

Our empirical analysis is based on the NEEMSIS-1 \& NEEMSIS-2 (Networks, Employment, dEbt, Mobilities and Skills in India Survey) surveys carried out respectively in 2016-17, and 2020-21 \citep{NEEMSISreport, NEEMSIS2017}.
This survey was the second and third waves of a longitudinal data collection project start in 2010 with RUME (RUral Microfinance and Employment survey) project in ten villages of Tamil Nadu.
Located in the Cuddalore and Villupuram districts, a mostly agricultural area, economies benefits from the proximity of two large industrial towns (Neyveli and Cuddalore) and a regional business center (Panruti).

RUME randomly selected 405 households using stratified sample framework based on three dimensions: proximity to small towns (Panruti, Villupuram and Cuddalore), an agro-ecological criterion, and caste affiliation.
Thus, half of villages are irrigated (the other half have dry lands) and within villages, half of the sample was selected from the mostly upper and middle caste part of the village (Ur) while the other half from the Colony part, where dalits (the ex-untouchables)  mainly live. 
NEEMSIS1 recovered 388 households (4.19\% attrition rate) and randomly selected 104 news households (for a total of 492 households) from these 10 villages, based on the same method. 
%Given that some households had migrated elsewhere between the 2010 and 2016-17 sampling periods (13\% of the recovered households).
NEEMSIS2 recovered 485 households (1.42\% attrition rate) from 2016-17 and recovered 10 households from 2010 that were not recovered in 2016-17.
Moreover, 100 news households were randomly selected (for a total of 595 households).

%While RUME survey focus on employment, migration and remittances, financial practices (such as loans, savings, lending practices, gold), agriculture, consumption and housing at household level, a new individual questionnaire have been added to NEEMSIS.
In NEEMSIS1 \& NEEMSIS2, two household members, called ``ego 1'' (mostly household questionnaire respondent) and ``ego 2'' (one younger household member randomly selected on a criterion of age), are directly addressed individual questionnaires that provide for instance a range of information on cognitive skills and personality traits.

NEEMSIS's surveys stands out from other Indian data sources such as the All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), as it has the rare and valuable advantage of recording debt at the individual level (identifying the person who went to the lender and borrowed in her own name).

Concerning the reliability, the great expertise of the team\footnote{Some members of the research team are present since more than twenty-year on the region for numerous quantitative and qualitative surveys.}, helped to formulate questions appropriately.
This for instance involved using particular terms that are less degrading than the generic term ``debt'' lists of the main local lenders, and asking indirect questions.
As stated by \cite{Reboul2021} (same data sets) ``[i]mproved data accuracy is for example reflected by an incidence of indebtedness found higher than in the estimates of the nation-wide AIDIS: 99\% of households are in debt in our case study, as opposed to 30\% in rural Tamil Nadu in 2012 according to the AIDIS \citep{NSSO2014}.'' 

Moreover, the moderate magnitude of the survey, compared to nationally representative datasets, ensures the high quality of the data and the tablet-based mode of data collection improved data quality in including constraints on answers to prevent inconsistencies. 

Our final sample consists of 473 households and 835 egos because in 2016-17, two households does not have egos; and for 10 households all egos have changed between 2016-17 and 2020-21 (see Appendix \ref{app:data}).







	% ******************************
	\subsection{Construction of personality traits \& cognitive skills variables }
	% ******************************

As stated earlier, our survey allow us to construct Big-5 personality traits.
On the basis of 35 questions relatives to Big-5 taxonomy, we averaged answers --based on a  Likert scale from 1-``Almost Never'' to 5-``Almost always'', that belong to a determined trait after correcting for acquiescence bias\footnote{Acquiescence bias represent the ``tendency for survey respondents to agree with statements regardless of their content'' \citep{Lavrakas2008}.} (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}).
The resulting mean represent the score on each traits.

\citeauthor{McDonald1999}'s $\upomega$\footnote{Literature on internal consistency estimators increasingly agrees that \citeauthor{Cronbach1951}'s $\upalpha$ --the most wide used estimator, is maybe not very efficient \citep{Bourque2019, TrizanoHermosilla2016}.}, a measure of internal consistency, are mostly satisfactory: 0.81 for openness; 0.86 for conscientiousness; 0.59 for extraversion; 0.60 for agreeableness and 0.80 for emotional stability.
%It is for corrected one
%For raw: 0.85 for OP; 0.84 for CO; 0.71 for EX; 0.43 for AG; 0.64 for ES
%0.60 (agreeableness), 0.61 (extraversion), 0.68 (grit), 0.77 (emotional stability), 0.78 (openness to experience), and 0.85 (conscientiousness)

Cognitive skills include three score variables: literacy, numeracy, Raven\footnote{Raven test is ``a nonverbal test of mental ability consisting of abstract designs, each of which is missing one part. The participant chooses the missing component from several alternatives to complete each design.'' -- \url{https://dictionary.apa.org/ravens-progressive-matrices}. Accessed January 27, 2021.}.
These scores are construct in adding up the correct answers of a set of four questions for literacy and numeracy test and 36 for Raven.

\paragraph{Exogeneity}
The exogeneity of personality traits is well assume because of stability over time while there is no consensus in psychology \citep{Ardelt2000}.

According to \cite{Costa1997, McCrae2000} it remains stable, in part, because it is a genetic predisposition that, by definition, cannot be changed over life.
Economist follow this path and the majority of then assume stability over time after the age of 25 and other verify this stability \citep{CobbClark2011}. 

This stability refutes sociological and psychological literature which interesting in the influence of childhood and adulthood socialization on personality \citep{Mortimer1978, Moen1995}.
Following this path, \cite{Ardelt2000} state that ``personality can change over the course of a person's life, particularly if age at first measurement is low or over 50, if the retest interval is large, if individual personality aspects rather than the overall personality are considered, and if personality aspects other than the big five NEO traits are assessed.''
%\footnote{See \cite{Ardelt2000} for comprehensive review on critics of stability.}

% \citep{Ardelt2000}
% First, ideally, it would be most promising to study personality before and after unexpected, drastic changes in people's social environments, particularly those which conflict with their existing personality dispositions (Caspi 1993; Stokes et al. 1989).
% Unemployment, a terminal illness, incarceration, natural disasters, or sudden political or economic upheaval tend to force individuals to adapt to an environment that they did not select and that may be difficult to shape and transform in accordance with their personality characteristics.
% Under those circumstances, successful adaptation indeed may require a change in the individual's personality. 
% Unfortunately it is generally not known when these unexpected changes in the social environment will occur; therefore studies of this kind will require a large budget to follow a diverse segment of society over a long period.

Our data allow us to examine stability over time of Big-5 personality traits for 835 individuals of rural India.
Calculating variation rate between 2016-17 and 2020-21 of each traits, results show a stability for minor part of the population (see Table \ref{fig:stab} of Appendix \ref{section:stab_big5}).


% Thus, in order to limit endogeneity --through reverse causality, we investigate the role of personality traits and cognitive skills (and all others independents variables) in 2016-17 on 2020-21 debt.



\paragraph{Factor analysis}
As warned by \cite{Laajaj2019}, the Big-Five taxonomy is limited in developing countries for several reasons: the enumerator-respondent interactions in face-to-face survey can induce a bias; the low education levels can make questions more difficult to understand and can induce a systematic response patterns, especially the acquiescence bias.

The very good knownledge of the field\footnote{More than 20 years.} allow us to collect data of high quality and avoid a bias due to misunderstanding of questions.
Moreover, we implement our own factor analysis of the 35 questions by principal component with promax rotation.
To avoid a bias in factor analysis, we do not corrected for acquiescence bias. % because it suppose that one reverse questions have the same meaning as one question.
In our dataset, acquiesence bias is measure with a set of reverse questions that are supposed perfectly opposed to another set of questions. 
However, the assumption of opposition is supportable only in the Big-5 taxonomy, in another layout pairs of questions can measure different aspects of personality.

The resulting factors are relatively similar to the Big-5 personality traits (see Table \ref{tab:corrbig5efa}) with satisfactory \citeauthor{McDonald1999}'s $\upomega$: Factor 1 as Extraversion-Openness ($\upomega=0.91)$; Factor 2 as Conscientiousness ($\upomega=0.87)$; Factor 3 as Emotional stability-Conscientiousness ($\upomega=0.76)$; Factor 4 as Emotional stability ($\upomega=0.81)$ and Factor 5 as Agreeableness ($\upomega=0.64)$.

\paragraph{Life-cycle effects}
To mitigate against the potential problem of life-cycle events --that might induce endogeneity through measurement error, we run univariate OLS regression with cognitive skills and personality traits as endogenous variables and age as exogenous variable (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}).
We standardised the resulting residuals and use it as cognitive and personality measures net of life cycle influences \citep{Nyhus2005, Brown2014}.

	\subsection{Indebtedness measures}
	% ******************************

Before exploring the role of cognitive skills and personality traits, it is necessary to discuss debt and over-indebtedness measures.
There is no consensus in the literature but three approaches are often retained \citep{Betti2007, Ferreira2000}.
Objective measures focus on the ability (or inability) to service or repay debts.
Typically, it is the debt to income ratio, debt to asset ratio, debt service ratio.
Over-indebtedness occurs when a certain threshold is exceeded.
Although this is the most widely used measure, it under-estimate the burden of debt in ousting personal feeling and sacrifice associated with debt and over-indebtedness \citep{Betti2007}.
 
Subjectives measure assume that ``individual households are the best judges of their own net debt/wealth position'' \citep{Betti2007}.
The robustness of the results are based on the degree of honesty and literacy of individuals that can make it, sometimes, less reliable \citep{Betti2007, DAlessio2013}.
As stated by \cite{Rinaldi2006} and \cite{Keese2012}, in general, objective measures align quite well with subjective measures at the household classification level.

Administrative measures treat indebtedness and over-indebtedness as ``all cases
where non-payment of debts have been registered officially or declared before a court'' \citep{Betti2007}.
In rural Indian context, this type of measures have little meaning since most of the debt is informal.

In order to best measure the debt, we could combine objective and subjective measures as \cite{Aniola2012} do in European Countries, but this brings the risk that all households will find themselves categorized as over-indebted according to the measure used \citep{Chichaibelu2018}.

It is recommended to analyse indebtedness at household level because generally income is grouped between household members \citep{European2010}.
However, in order to explore the role of individual characteristics such as personality and cognitive skills on indebtedness, we focus on three types of individual objective measures allowing us to understand the debt from three angles.

First, we investigate the size of the individual debt with the total amount of individual debt taken out in her own name.
Second, we investigate the burden of debt repayment with the individual debt service ratio\footnote{$DSR=\frac{Debt~service}{Annual~Income}$ which represent the share of income required to cover the repayment of interest and principal on a debt for one year.} (DSR).


% First, we wish to understand the role of personality traits \& cognitive skills on the incidence of individual debt --through the probability of being in debt\footnote{Dummy variable equal to 1 if the individual has some unsettled debt taken out in her own name, 0 otherwise.} in 2020-21.

	\subsection{Econometric framework}
	% ******************************

%À la base, je souhaitais voir si dans des carcans, des individus se différenciés.
%Je comptais donc ségmenter l'analyse par caste et par genre: Dalits women, dalits men, MUC women, MUC men
%La littérature sur les aspirations montre qu'il y a des différences fondamentales entre les sexes et entre les castes, donc partir de ce postulat pour voir si bien que les individus soient conditionnées par ça, certains se différencient en termes de dette.

%Problème d'échantillon trop faible (150 par sous groupe), donc parfois les cluster ne fonctionnaient pas, obliger de les enlever..
%Puis les stat de F ou le Khi2 sortaient trop faibles donc tous les X pris ensemble, rien nétait significatif

%Donc, pour gagner en puissance statistique, je prends l'échantillon totale avec des interractive, jusqu'à 3 interactions.

% Pour l'interpretation, tel trait de personnalité joue d'autant plus que l'individus est une femme dalit
%Pourquoi je croise par ca ? car on sait que ca 

To analyse the relationship between personality traits and individual indebtedness, we proceed in two stages.
1. understand how personality shapes individual debt; how personality determine the level of debt.
To limit reverse causality, 

\subsubsection{Role of skills on future debt}

In a first step, we use the lagged personality traits on individual debt (the role of personnality traits in $t$ on the individual debt in $t+1$) to understand how personality shapes individual debt.




Our analysis faces sample selection issues because of the nature of our dependent variables: the sample is restricted to those who declared a non-zero and non-missing debt.
We therefore do not account for entry and exit in debt by only considering total loan amount and debt service ratio.
To overcome this sample selection issue, we use a \cite{Heckman1976} model to estimate the effect of PT\&CS on indebtedness.
The household debt dependency ratios, defined as the number of indebtedness individuals divided by the total number of household members, in 2016-17 are used as exclusion restriction variables, allowing to compute an Inverse Mill’s Ratios to correct for selection in our equations of interest.


\cite{Puhani2000}


First, to estimates dummy variables, we use probit modele with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and we clusterize the error at household level.
Same estimator for over-indebtedness because dummy variable too. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:probit}
\begin{split}
P(Y=1|x)=\upphi(\upbeta_{0}+X'_{1}\upbeta_{1})
\end{split}
\end{equation}


To estimates the total loan amount, we use OLS with cluster at household level and not use tobit model because our data are not censored or truncated, but defined on $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ \citep{Maddala1991}.
For IDSR, we also use OLS with cluster at household level and not GLM because of the upper bound of the variable ($+\infty$ and not 1).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ols}
\begin{split}
Y_{i}~=~\upalpha~+~X'_i\upbeta~+~Z'_{i}\upgamma~+~\upepsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}




\paragraph{Data structure and clustering}
As mention earlier, in our data, individual questionnaire concerned two individuals ``egos'' of each household.
In analyzing debt at individual scale here, we investigate the role of personality traits \& cognitive skills for all ``egos''.
\dev{Cluster car plusieurs indiv par HH = non indépendants en stat et dans la lit avec allocation of ressources:}
Question of the allocation of ressources within household is, obviously, essential in this configuration.
Indeed, \citep{Lazear1988}
\citep{Bonke2015} We find that in most households the income distribution is correlated with the sharing of consumption—the economic approach—and that this holds true even if the household pools its resources—the economic psychology approach, implying that there is no strong relationship between the two approaches.

Thus, we clustered error by households to take into account the fact that observations within each household are not independently and identically distributed.


interaction variable




\subsubsection{Fixed effects}
In a second step, we fully accept the non-stability of personnality traits by using the variation of Big-5 personality traits through time with fixed effect model. 


Non corrected traits because, de facon globale, meilleure internal consistancy

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Control variables}
Our control variables are based on \cite{Reboul2021, Brown2014, Chichaibelu2017} which take the existing classic controls. 
We use two vector of variables in 2016-17.

One at individual level, includes: age; age square; dummy variable which take 1 if individual is the household head, 0 otherwise; main occupation\footnote{Define as the most time-consuming activity.}; number of occupation (dummyvariable if plusieurs occupations plutôt); dummy variable which take 1 if individual received formal education through school, 0 otherwise (no formal education) and a dummy variable for marital status (1 if married, 0 otherwise). 
And households controls: 

One at household level, includes: monetary value of assets\footnote{The monetary value of assets includes the monetary value of gold; land; house; livestock; agricultural equipment and consumption good such as car, computer, cookgas, phone, etc.}; sex ratio; annual income; household size; number of children (individual under 16 years old); shock exposure (dummy variable which take 1 if the household experienced a shock\footnote{Marriage of at least one of the household members or/and household surveyed after the demonetisation.} between 2010 and 2016-17, 0 if not); number of income sources. 
Finally, we added villages fixed effects.






%\paragraph{Caveat}
%An important caveat to acknowledge is the fact that this paper does not claim to seek causality. 
%Although we assume that personality traits are exogenous regressor, there is no consensus among psychologist as we note earlier.
%As many other paper \citep{Brown2014, Bucciol2017, Pinjisakikool2017, Pinjisakikool2017b, CobbClark2016, Bertoni2019}, our empirical analysis relate to correlation because of we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality between our endogenous variables and our supposed exogenous personality traits.
%At the time of writing, only \cite{Parise2019} deal with reverse causality issue in instrumenting conscientiousness and neuroticism with exposition to shock during childhood.

\section{Descriptive statistics}
% ***********************************

\paragraph{Household unit in Table \ref{tab:descHH}}
Our final sample consists of 835 individuals from 473 households and almost half are dalits.
Three quarters of households have 2 egos, the last quarters have only one egos.
The sex ratio is significantly different through caste: in 24\% of dalits households there are as many men as women while in middle-upper caste, it is 34\% of households.
In terms of assets, middle-upper caste households are three times richer than dalits on average --respectively 1,493,350 INR and 487,420 INR.
50\% of middle-upper caste have less than 666,500 INR of assets while 50\% of dalits households have less than 266,400 INR.
This economic advantage is also found with income: the median income of middle-upper caste is 33.71\% higher than dalits one (respectively 142,200 INR and 106,350 INR).
We do not find difference in terms of shock and indebtedness between caste: 57\% of households faced a shock between 2016-17 and 2020-21 and 99\% of households have at least one outstanding loan.
		
\subimport{INPUT}{desc_HH.tex}

\paragraph{Individual unit in Table \ref{tab:descindiv}}
At egos scale, 22\% of our sample are dalits female, 26\% are dalits male, 22\% are middle-upper caste female and 30\% are middle-upper caste male.
Dalits women are, on average, the youngest (39 years old) and middle-upper caste male are the oldest (45 years old).
Three quarters of male are the head of household while female are only 9\%.
In terms of education, middle-upper caste are more formal educated than dalits and male than female.
Thus, 48\% of dalits female received formal education at school and this rate is around 76\% for middle-upper caste male.

Significant differences through caste and gender are found in terms of occupation.
One quarter of middle-upper caste male have agriculture as main occupation, more than three times higher than other groups (going to 16 times for dalits female).
Self-employment is also over-represented for middle-upper caste male: while there are 20\%, there only are 13\% for dalits male, and last than 6\% for female (dalits and non-dalits).
Salaried job in agriculture appears as one of the major main occupation for dalits (37\% for female and 26\% for male) but not for non-dalits (17\% for female and 7\% for male).
There is no important differences for salaried job in non-agricultural activity through the four groups (from 34\% for non-dalits male to 44\% for dalits male).
A third of non-dalits female have unpaid work as main occupation --or they does not work at all, while they are less than 13\% among middle-upper male, 10\% among dalits male and 15\% among dalits female.
The significant differences between caste corroborate with data on labour income:
On average, male have 102,000 INR per year as labour income, but the standard deviation is more than two times lower for non-dalits thus 50\% of non-dalits have 67,000 INR per year while 50\% of dalits have 45,000 INR.
Non-dalits individual have more income generating occupation that allow members of household to not work. \dev{literature}
The conclusion is the same with data on multiple occupation.
More than a half of dalits female (55\%) have more than one occupation, while there are ``only'' 45\% among middle-upper caste female.
For male, more than a third of non-dalits have multiple occupation while they are 42\% among dalits.
Finally, on average, female have more than five times less than male in terms of labour income (around 20,000 INR per year for female and 102,000 INR for male).

\paragraph{Personality traits \& cognitive skills in Figure \ref{fig:EGOscore}}

Figure \ref{fig:EGOscore} shows the distribution of each personality traits net of life-cycle.
Middle-upper caste male tends to be more extraverted-openned than others (Factor 1).
For Conscientiousness (Factor 2), male have significant higher score than women, whatever the caste (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}, Table \ref{tab:anovaperso}).
Dalits tend to be more emotional stable and conscientiousness (Factor 3) than non-dalits
and dalits male more emotional stable than other (Factor 4).
For Agreeableness (Factor 5), we do not find significant differences between our four groups (see Appendix \ref{section:efa_big5}, Table \ref{tab:anovaperso}).
In terms of cognitive skills, male tends to have higher score.

\paragraph{Individual debt with Table \ref{tab:descY} and \ref{tab:descXY}}

Dalits female are more indebted than others, but there is no statistical evidence: 79\% of dalits female while 71\% for others.
Middle-upper caste male have highest total loan amount (124,440 INR that represent 1.21 years of labour income for the average dalit male), relatively similar for other groups (mean around 66,000 INR).
But, the distribution is very different: median at 54 for dalits female, around 24 for dalits male and non-dalits female.

Number of loans 

IDSR, share of income for principal and interest repayment can represent the burden of debt: double jeopardy for dalits female 185.87\% on average and 44\% for 50\% of individuals while 4\% for dalit male, 26\% for middle-upper caste female and 4\% for middle-upper caste male.


Female more over-indebted than male :

Female more loans but amount smaller than male => indebtedness for daily expenditures female and investment for male


Table \ref{tab:descXY} shows correlation test between personality traits \& cognitive skills and individual indebtedness measures.
For dalits, cognitive skills sems to be more correlated with debt than personality traits.
Indeed, Numeracy appears as well negatively correlated with indebtedness measure for dalits, as Raven.
Literacy seems to be positively correlated with individual debt for male while it is negatively correlated for female IDSR, whatever the caste.

Factor 1 --as Extraversion-Openness, is significantly positively correlated with individual debt service ratio for dalits female while, for dalits male, Factor 3 --as ESCO, is significantlty negatively correlated with the probability of being in debt in 2020-21.
For middle-upper caste female, Factor 1 is more correlated with the probability of being in debt than Raven test (respectively -0.18 and -0.13) 
Factor 1 to 4 are always negatively correlated with indebtedness measure for non-dalits female, going against cognitive skills for individual debt service ratio: Factor 3 and Factor 4 are negatively correlated while Raven, Numeracy and Literacy are positively correlated with the ratio.

Last, for non-dalits male, Factor 1 pulls debt in opposite directions depending on the measure used: it is positively correlated with loan amount and over-indebtedness (strongest relation with loan amount) and negatively correlated with the number of loans.
\dev{Peut-être car les gens très F1 ont peu de prêts mais des montants élevés, ca semble cohérent avec les hommes qui empruntent plus pour un besoin économique, donc besoin d'être EXOP alors que Femme petits prêts mais beaucoup : il n'y a que voir les montants avec les stat descriptives précédents}

\section{Data description}
\label{app:data}

In 2016-17, 492 households, 2,696 individuals, 953 egos.
But, 2 households without egos.
So we have 490 households and 953 egos.
NEEMSIS2 (2020-21) recovered 485 households, 2,635 individuals.
But, 600+1 individuals have left their households between the two wave, whose 98 egos.
Which mean that we have 485 housholds and 2,034 individuals.
But, we always have our two households without egos in 2016-17 that we can not compare.
Thus, we have 483 households.
But, for 10 households all egos have changed between 2016-17 and 2020-21.
Egos of 2016-17 are still here in 2020-21, but they do not be selected as egos. 
Finally, our sample is constitute from 835 egos represented 473 households.

% % ***********************************
% \subsection{Hypothesis}
% % ***********************************

% As we already note, the goal of this paper is to analyze the role of cognitive skills and personality traits on indebtedness in a context where \jati and gender conditionned individuals.


% firstly, check the contextual determinants of debt.
% Then, we add personality traits \& cognitive skills in the analysis to answer our first question: is cognitive skills and personality traits plays a significant role on indebtedness situation of households in rural India?
% Following literature, we can make H\ref{hyp:stability}.
% Indeed, concerning conscientiousness, \cite{Donnelly2012} state that ``highly conscientious individuals manage their money more because they have positive financial attitudes as well as a future orientation''.
% \cite{Brown2014, Nyhus2001} find similar results: conscientious individuals are less likely to have ever been in debt and conscientiousness is negatively related to the amount of unsecured debt.
% \cite{Nga2013} find that conscientiousness have a significant influence on risk aversion in Malaysia.
% \cite{Forlicz2019} find that for most of these countries there existed significant differences between debtors and debt-free individuals regarding the level of conscientiousness
% For neuroticism, \cite{Pinjisakikool2017b} find that emotional stability (inverse of neuroticism) significantly predict financial risk tolerance.

% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:stability}] \label{hyp:stability}
% Conscientiousness and neuroticism play significant role on household indebtedness [and over-indebtedness].
% \end{hyp}

% To understand the phenomenon more in depth, we decompose the analysis by caste, class and gender.
% The notion of class allow us to encompass ``property, wealth, occupation, income, and education'' \citep{Beteille2007}.
% We implement a multiple correspondance analysis with land property, wealth, occupation and income\footnote{We choose to not take into account education to stay at household level.} to create a dichotomy between high and low class (see appendix \ref{section:mca_class}).
% For caste and class decomposition, we formulate H\ref{hyp:poorer} imagining that cognitive skills are more important for lower households because we can imagine that higher one have all a high level of cognitive skills (math, literacy, etc.) because of better level of education\footnote{For the link between caste and education, see \cite{Borooah2005}.}.
% %\cite{Gaurav2012} find that cognitive skills significantly predict the financial aptitude and debt literacy for rural farmer in Gujarat
% %\cite{Agarwal2013} finds that ``consumers with higher math scores, are substantially less likely to make a financial mistake'' in separating our sample between economically and socially upper households and economically and socially lower households.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:poorer}] \label{hyp:poorer}
% Cognitive skills are better predictors for lower households than for higher one. 
% \end{hyp}

% Concerning gender, as \cite{Reboul2020} stated: ``[w]omen in the poorest households, despite meager incomes, have the highest borrowing responsibilities, shouldering the highest shares of household debt. [...] Their larger role in household debt management may be linked to their greater mobility and lower restrictions on social interactions, notably with men, which would underpin both their greater income shares and their access to credit relations. ''
% Thus, we can formulate the H\ref{hyp:women} hypothesis.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:women}] \label{hyp:women}
% When ego is a woman, her cognitive skills and personality traits play a bigger role in household finances than when ego is a man.
% \end{hyp}

% \cite{Reboul2019} Far beyond the issue of information about wages, the management of family finances leads
% to constant tensions and conflicts among family members, and thus gives rise to various tactics
% aimed at partially overcoming family constraints. This is particularly true for women, who have
% a heavy responsibility to ensure, among other things, daily expenses


% Last, we explore the source and use of debt in creating the dichotomy formal--informal and income generator--non-income generator of debt.
% Following results of \cite{Brown2014}, we formulate H\ref{hyp:filr}.
% \begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:filr}] \label{hyp:filr}
% Conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openess to experience have an association with informal debt.
% \end{hyp}

% To try to verify our hypotheses, we use original data set from rural south India.

% \cite{Guerin2014a} il faut aussi que je regarde le rôle des compétences cognitives sur la négociation de la dette en cross section : qui sont ceux qui arrivent le mieux à négocier leur dette ? 
% Comment savoir la negociation de la dette ? C'est le prix de la dette

%\paragraph{Retirement assets}
%Compared to China, the retirement pensions are not very efficient.
%Indeed, around 90\% of labor is informal [in the sense of absence of social insurance] and 85\% of non-agricultural workforce is informal \citep{Mehrotra2019}.
%For \cite{Badarinza2016b}, India figures as an outlier among low-middle-income countries on this point.
%\paragraph{Gold}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item On average, gold represent more than 11\% of indien household balance sheet  while it is less than 1\% in China \citep{Badarinza2016b}.
%\item Préciser les différences rurales urbaines de \cite{Badarinza2016b}.
%\item Mais rester sur le fait qu'au TN l'or est la première forme d'épargne d'après \cite{Roesch2008} \cite{Guerin2012a}
%\item Pourquoi ils aiment tant ?
%\item[1] Real estate has lower liquidity when compared with gold, and if liquidity needs are correlated with inflation volatility, gold better serves the purpose than real estate. Gold as a non-financial asset also has additional properties that are not provided for by real estate, such as a high collateral value and physical verifiability \citep{Badarinza2016b}
%\item[2] Avec la littérature d'Isabelle, parler du social role de l'or en rural India.

% \item[2] Les indicateurs doivent couvrir tous les aspects des engagements financiers : le logement, le crédit à la consommation, les factures, les emprunts hypothécaires ;
% \item[3] Le surendettement est considéré comme un état structurel car il implique une incapacité à faire face à des dépenses récurrentes ;
% \item[4] Le surendettement ne se résout pas en empruntant davantage ;
% \item[5] Pour qu’un ménage respecte ses engagements, il doit réduire considérablement ses dépenses ou trouver un moyen d’accroître ses revenus.
